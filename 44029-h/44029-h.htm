<h2>FOREWORD</h2>

<p>Mind and Body—Mental States and Physical
Conditions! To the mind of those who
have contented themselves with merely the
superficial aspects of things, these two things—mind
and body; and mental states and
physical conditions—seem to be as far apart
as the two poles; seem to be opposites and
contradictories impossible of reconciliation.
But to those who have penetrated beneath the
surface of things, these two apparent opposites
are seen to be so closely related and inter-related—so
blended and mingled together
in manifestation—that it is practically impossible
to scientifically determine where the
one leaves off and the other begins. And so
constant and close is their mutual action and
reaction, that it often becomes impossible to
state positively <i>which</i> is the cause and which
the effect.</p>

<p>In the first place, Science now informs us
that in all living substance, from cell to mam<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>moth,
there is and must be Mind. There can
be no Life without Mind. Mind, indeed, is
held to be the very “livingness” of Life—the
greater the degree of manifestation of
Mind, the higher the degree of Life. Moreover,
the New Psychology informs us that
upon the activities of the Subconscious Mind
depend all the processes of physical life—that
the Subconscious Mind is the essence of
what was formerly called the Vital Force—and
is embodied in every cell, cell-group or
organ of the body. And, that this Subconscious
Mind is amenable to suggestion, good
and evil, from the conscious mind of its
owner, as well as from outside. When the
subject of the influence of Mental States upon
Physical Conditions is studied, one sees that
the Physical Condition is merely the reflection
of the Mental State, and the problem
seems to be solved, the mystery of Health
and Disease solved. But in this, as in everything
else, there is seen to be an opposing
phase—the other side of the shield. Let us
look at the other side of the question:</p>

<p>Just as we find that wherever there is living
substance there is Mind, so do we find<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
that we are unable to intelligently consider
Mind unless as <i>embodied</i> in living substance.
The idea of Mind, independent of its substantial
embodiment, becomes a mere abstraction
impossible of mental imaging—something
like color independent of the colored
substance, or light without the illuminated
substance. And just as we find that
Mental States influence Physical Conditions,
so do we find that Physical Conditions influence
Mental States. And, so the problem
of Life, Health and Disease once more loses
its simplicity, and the mystery again deepens.
The deeper we dig into the subject, the
more do we become impressed with the idea
of the universal principle of Action and Reaction
so apparent in all phenomena. The
Mind acts upon the Body; the Body reacts
upon the Mind; cause and effect become confused;
the reasoning becomes circular—like
a ring it has no beginning, no end; its beginning
may be any place we may prefer, its
ending likewise.</p>

<p>The only reconciliation is to be found in
the fundamental working hypothesis which
holds that both Mind and Body—both Men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>tal
States and Physical Conditions—are <i>the
two aspects of something greater than either—the
opposing poles of the same Reality</i>.
The radical Materialist asserts that the Body
is the only reality, and that Mind is merely
its “by-product.” The Mentalist asserts
that the Mind is the only reality, and that
the Body is merely its grosser form of manifestation.
The unprejudiced philosopher is
apt to stand aside and say: “You are both
right, yet both wrong—each is stating the
truth, but only the half-truth.” With the
working hypothesis that Mind and Body are
but varying aspects of the Truth—that Mind
is the inner essence of the Body, and Body
the outward manifestation of the Mind—we
find ourselves on safe ground.</p>

<p>We mention this fundamental principle
here, for in the body of this book we shall
not invade the province of metaphysics or
philosophy, but shall hold ourselves firmly to
our own field, that of psychology. Of course,
the very nature of the subject renders it necessary
that we consider the influence of psychology
upon physiology, but we have remembered
that this book belongs to the gen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>eral
subject of the New Psychology, and we
have accordingly emphasized the psychological
side of the subject. But the same material
could have been used by a writer upon
physiology, by changing the emphasis from
the psychological phase to the physiological.</p>

<p>We have written this book to reach not
only those who refuse to see the wonderful
influence of the Mental States over the Physical
Conditions, but also for our “metaphysical”
friends who have become so enamored
with the power of the Mind that they practically
ignore the existence of the Body, indeed,
in some cases, actually denying the existence
of the latter. We believe that there
is a sane middle-ground in “metaphysical
healing,” as there is in the material treatment
of disease. In this case, not only does
Truth lie between the two extremes, but it is
composed of the blending and assimilation of
the two opposing ideas and theories. But,
even if the reader does not fully agree with
us in our general theories and conclusions, he
will find within the covers of this book a
mass of <i>facts</i> which he may use in building
up a new theory of his own. And, after all,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
what are theories but the threads upon which
are strung the beads of <i>facts</i>—if our string
does not meet with your approval, break it
and string the beads of fact upon a thread of
your own. Theories come, and theories go—but
<i>facts</i> remain.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>

<p class="center">THE SUBCONSCIOUS MIND</p>

<p>In order to understand the nature of the
influence of the mind upon the body—the
effect of mental states upon physical functions—we
must know something of that wonderful
field of mental activity which in the
New Psychology is known as “The Subconscious
Mind,” and which by some writers
has been styled the “Subjective Mind;” the
“Involuntary Mind;” the “Subliminal
Mind;” the “Unconscious Mind,” etc., the
difference in names arising because of the
comparative newness of the investigation
and classification.</p>

<p>Among the various functions of the Subconscious
Mind, one of the most important is
that of the charge and control of the involuntary
activities and functions of the human
body through the agency of the sympathetic
nervous system, the cells, and cell-groups.
As all students of physiology know, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
greater part of the activities of the body are
involuntary—that is, are independent (or
partly so) of the control of the conscious
will. As Dr. Schofield says: “The unconscious
mind, in addition to the three qualities
which it shares in common with the conscious—<i>viz.</i>,
will, intellect and emotion—has
undoubtedly another very important one—nutrition,
or the general maintenance of the
body.” And as Hudson states: “The subjective
mind has absolute control of the functions,
conditions and sensations of the body.”
Notwithstanding the dispute which is still
raging concerning <i>what</i> the Subconscious
mind <i>is</i>, the authorities all agree upon the
fact that, whatever else it may be, it may be
considered as that phase, aspect, part, or field
of the mind which has charge and control of
the greater part of the physical functioning
of the body.</p>

<p>Von Hartmann says: “The explanation
that unconscious psychical activity itself appropriately
forms and maintains the body
has not only nothing to be said against it, but
has all possible analogies from the most different
departments of physical and animal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
life in its favor, and appears to be as scientifically
certain as is possible in the inferences
from effect to cause.” Maudsley says:
“The connection of mind and body is such
that a given state of mind tends to echo itself
at once in the body.” Carpenter says: “If
a psychosis or mental state is produced by a
neurosis or material nerve state, as pain by
a prick, so also is a neurosis produced by a
psychosis. That mental antecedents call
forth physical consequents is just as certain
as that physical antecedents call forth mental
consequents.” Tuke says: “Mind,
through sensory, motor, vaso-motor and
trophic nerves, causes changes in sensation,
muscular contraction, nutrition and secretion....
If the brain is an outgrowth
from a body corpuscle and is in immediate
relation with the structures and tissues that
preceded it, then, though these continue to
have their own action, the brain must be expected
to act upon the muscular tissue, the
organic functions and upon the nervous system
itself.”</p>

<p>Von Hartmann also says: “In willing any
conscious act, the unconscious will is evoked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
to institute means to bring about the effect.
Thus, if I will a stronger salivary secretion,
the conscious willing of this effect excites the
unconscious will to institute the necessary
means. Mothers are said to be able to provide
through the will a more copious secretion,
if the sight of the child arouses in them
the will to suckle. There are people who perspire
voluntarily. I now possess the power
of instantaneously reducing the severest hiccoughs
to silence by my own will, while it
was formerly a source of great inconvenience
to me.... An irritation to cough, which
has no mechanical cause, may be permanently
suppressed by the will. I believe we might
possess a far greater voluntary power over
our bodily functions if we were only accustomed
from childhood to institute experiments
and to practice ourselves therein....
We have arrived at the conclusion
that every action of the mind on the body,
without exception, is only possible by means
of an unconscious will; that such an unconscious
will can be called forth partly by
means of a conscious will, partly also through
the conscious idea of the effect, without con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>scions
will, and even in opposition to the
conscious will.”</p>

<p>Henry Wood says of the Subconscious
Mind: “It acts automatically upon the physical
organism. It cognizes external facts,
conditions, limitations, and even contagions,
quite independent of its active counterpart.
One may, therefore, ‘take’ a disease and be
unaware of any exposure. The subconsciousness
has been unwittingly trained to fear,
and accept it; and it is this quality, rather
than the mere inert matter of the body, that
succumbs. Matter is never the actor, but is
always acted upon. This silent, mental partner,
in operation, seems to be a living, thinking
personality, conducting affairs on its
own account. It is a compound of almost unimaginable
variety, including wisdom and
foolishness, logic and nonsense, and yet having
a working unitary economy. It is a hidden
force to be dealt with and educated, for
it is often found insubordinate and unruly.
It refuses co-operation with its lesser but
more active and wiser counterpart. It is
very ‘set’ in its views, and only changes its
qualities and opinions by slow degrees. But,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
like a pair of horses, not until these two mental
factors can be trained together can there
be harmony and efficiency.”</p>

<p>In order to understand the important part
played in the physical economy by the Subconscious
Mind, it is only necessary to understand
the various processes of the human
system which are out of the ordinary field
of the voluntary or conscious mind. We then
realize that the entire process of nutrition,
including digestion, assimilation, etc., the
processes of elimination, the processes of
circulation, the processes of growth, in fact
the entire processes manifested in the work
of the cells, cell-groups, ganglia, physical organs,
etc., are in charge of and controlled by
the Subconscious Mind. Our food is digested
and transformed into the nourishing substances
of the blood; then carried through
the arteries to all parts of the body, where
it is absorbed by the cells and used to replace
the worn-out material, the latter then being
carried back through the veins to the lungs
where the waste matter is burned up, and the
balance again sent on its journey through the
arteries re-charged with the life-giving oxy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>gen.
All of these processes, and many others
of almost equal importance, are out of the
field of the conscious or voluntary mind, and
are governed by the Subconscious Mind. As
we shall see when we consider the Sympathetic
Nervous System, the greater part of
the body is dominated by the Subconscious
Mind, and that the welfare of the major
physical functions depends entirely, or almost
so, upon this great area or field of the
mind.</p>

<p>The best authorities now generally agree
that there is no part of the body which may
be considered as devoid of mind. The Subconscious
Mind is not confined to the brain,
or even the greater plexuses of the nervous
system, but extends to all parts of the body,
to every nerve, muscle, and even to every
cell and cell-group of the body. The functions
and processes of the body are no longer
considered as purely mechanical, or chemical,
but are now seen to be the result of mental
action of some kind or degree. Therefore,
in considering the Subconscious Mind,
one must not think of it as resident in the
brain alone, but rather as being <i>distributed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
over the entire physical body</i>. There is
mind in every cell, every organ, every muscle,
every nerve—in every part of the body.</p>

<p>The importance of the above statements
regarding the power and importance of the
Subconscious Mind may be realized when
one remembers the dictum of the New Psychology,
to wit: <i>The Subconscious Mind is
amenable to Suggestion</i>. When it is realized
that this great controller of the physical organism
is so constituted that it accepts as
truth the suggestions from the conscious
mind of its owner, as well as those emanating
from the conscious minds of other people, it
may be understood why Faith, Belief, and
Expectant Attention manifest such marked
effects upon the physical body and the general
health, for good or for evil, as indicated
in the preceding chapters. All of the many
instances and examples recited in the preceding
chapters may be understood when it
is realized that the Subconscious Mind, which
is in control of the physical functions and
vital processes, will accept the suggestions
from the conscious mind of its owner, and
also suggestions from outside which the con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>scious
mind of its owner allows to pass down
to it. If, as Henry Wood has said in the
paragraph previously quoted, it “acts automatically
upon the physical organism,” and
“seems to be a living, thinking personality,
conducting affairs on its own account,” and
at the same time, <i>accepts and ‘takes on’ suggested
conditions</i>, it may be readily understood
how the wonderful and almost incredible
statements of the authorities mentioned
in the preceding chapters have had real and
substantial basis in truth.</p>

<p>This understanding of the part played by
the Subjective Mind in controlling and affecting
physical conditions and activities, together
with its suggestible qualities and nature,
gives us a key to the whole question of
the “Why?” of Mental Healing. Suggestion
is the connecting link between Mind and
Body, and an understanding of its laws and
principles enables one to see the moving
cause of the strange phenomena of the Faith
Cures, under whatever name they may pass,
and under whatever guise they may present
themselves. “Suggestion” is the explanation
offered by the New Psychology for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
almost miraculous phenomena which other
schools seek to explain upon some hypothesis
based either upon religious beliefs, or
upon some metaphysical or philosophical doctrine.
The New Psychology holds that it is
not necessary to go outside of the realms of
psychology and physiology in studying Mental
Healing or Psycho-Therapy; and that the
theories of the semi-religious and metaphysical
cults are merely strange guises or masks
which serve to conceal the real operative
principle of cure.</p>

<p>The following quotation from Dr. Schofield
will serve to call the attention to the
important part played by the Subconscious
Mind in the physical activities, a fact which
is not generally recognized: “It has often
been a mystery how the body thrives so well
with so little oversight or care on the part of
its owner. No machine could be constructed,
nor could any combination of solids or liquids
in organic compounds, regulate, control,
counteract, help, hinder or arrange for the
continual succession of differing events,
foods, surroundings and conditions which are
constantly affecting the body. And yet, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
the midst of this ever-changing and varying
succession of influences, the body holds on its
course of growth, health, nutrition and self-maintenance
with the most marvelous constancy.
We perceive, of course, clearly, that
the best of qualities—regulation, control,
etc., etc.—are all mental qualities, and at the
same time we are equally clear that by no
self-examination can we say we consciously
exercise any of these mental powers over the
organic processes of our bodies. One would
think, then, that the conclusion is sufficiently
simple and obvious—that they must be used
unconsciously; in other words, it is, and can
be nothing else than <i>unconscious mental powers</i>
that control, guide and govern the functions
and organs of the body.</p>

<p>“Our ordinary text-books on physiology
give but little idea of what I may call the intelligence
that presides over the various systems
of the body, showing itself in the bones,
as we have seen, in distributing the available
but insufficient amount of lime salts in disease;
not equally, but for the protection of
the most vital parts, leaving those of lesser
value disproportionally deficient. In the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
muscular system nearly all contractions are
involuntary. Even in the voluntary (so-called)
muscles, the most we can do is to will
results. We do not will the contractions that
carry out these results. Muscles, striped
and unstriped, are ceaselessly acting without
the slightest consciousness in maintaining
the balance of the body, the expression
of the face, the general attributes corresponding
to mental states, the carrying on of digestion
and other processes with a purposiveness,
and adaptation of means to new
ends and new conditions, ceaselessly arising,
that are beyond all material mechanism.
Consider, for instance, the marvelous increase
of smooth muscle in the uterus at
term, and also its no less marvelous subsequent
involution; observe, too, the compensating
muscular increase of a damaged heart
until the balance is restored and the necessity
for it ceases, as does growth at a fixed
period; consider in detail the repair of a
broken bone. These actions are not mere
properties of matter; they demand, and are
the result of, a controlling mind.</p>

<p>“The circulation does not go round as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
most text-books would lead us to believe, as
the result merely of the action of a system
of elastic tubes, connected with a self-acting
force-pump. It is such views as these that
degrade physiology and obscure the marvels
of the body. The circulation never flows for
two minutes in the same manner. In an instant,
miles of capillaries are closed or
opened up, according to the ever-varying
body needs, of which, consciously, we are entirely
unaware. The blood supply of each
organ is not mechanical, but is carefully
regulated from minute to minute in health,
exactly according to its needs and activities,
and when this ever fails, we at once recognize
it as disease, and call it congestion and
so forth. The very heart-beat itself is never
constant, but varies <i>pro rata</i> with the amount
of exercise, activity of vital functions, of
conditions of temperature, etc., and even of
emotions and other direct mental feelings.
The whole reproductive system is obviously
under the sway and guidance of more than
blind material forces. In short, when thoroughly
analyzed, the action and regulation of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
no system of the body can be satisfactorily
explained, without postulating an unconscious
mental element, which <i>does</i>, if allowed,
satisfactorily explain all the phenomena.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>

<p class="center">THE SYMPATHETIC SYSTEM</p>

<p>The average person has a general understanding
of what is meant by “the nervous
system,” but inquiry will show that by this
term he usually includes only that part of
the nervous system which is known as the
“cerebro-spinal system,” or the system of
nerves consisting of the brain and spinal
cord, and the nerves extending therefrom
throughout the body, the offices of which are
to control the voluntary movements of the
body. The average person is almost entirely
ignorant of the existence of the Great Sympathetic
System which controls the involuntary
movements and processes, such as the
processes and functions of nutrition, secretion,
reproduction, excretion, the vaso-motor
action, etc. In physiology, the term “sympathetic”
is used in the sense of: “Reciprocal
action of the different parts of the body
on each other; an affection of one part of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
body in consequence of something taking
place in another. Thus when there is a local
injury, the whole frame after a time suffers
with it. A wound anywhere will tend to
create feverishness everywhere; derangement
of the stomach will tend to produce
headache, liver complaint to produce pain in
the shoulder, etc.”</p>

<p>An old authority thus describes the Sympathetic
Nerves: “A system of nerves, running
from the base of the skull to the coccyx,
along both sides of the body, and consisting
of a series of ganglia along the spinal column
by the side of the vertebræ. With this
trunk of the sympathetic there are communicating
branches which connect the ganglia,
or the intermediate cord, with all the spinal
and several of the cranial nerves proceeding
to primary branches on the neighboring organs
or other ganglia, and finally numerous
flexures of nerves running to the viscera.
Various fibers from the sympathetic communicate
with those of the cerebro-spinal system.
The term ‘sympathetic’ has been applied
on the supposition that it is the agent
in producing sympathy between different<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
parts of the body. It more certainly affects
the secretions.” In the New Psychology the
Sympathetic Nervous System is recognized
as that directly under the control of the Subconscious
Mind.</p>

<p>The Cerebro-Spinal Nervous System is
concerned with the activities arising from the
conscious activities of the mind, including
those of the five senses. It controls the
muscles by which we speak, walk, move our
limbs, and pursue the ordinary activities of
outer life. But, while these are very important
to the individual, there is another set of
activities—inner activities—which are none
the less important. The Sympathetic System
controls the involuntary muscles by
means of which the heart throbs, the arteries
pulsate, the air is conveyed to the lungs, the
blood moves to and from the heart, the various
glands and tubes of the body operate,
and the entire work of nutrition, repair, and
body-building is performed. While the Cerebro-Spinal
System, and the Conscious Mind
are able to rest a considerable portion of the
twenty-four hours of the day, the Sympathetic
System and the Subconscious Mind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
must needs work every minute of the twenty-four
hours, without rest or vacation, during
the life of their owner.</p>

<p>Dr. E. H. Pratt, in his valuable “Series of
Impersonations” published in the medical
magazines several years ago, and since reproduced
in book form, makes “The Sympathetic
Man” speak as follows: “The entire
body can do nothing without me; and my occupation
of supplying the inspiration for our
entire family is so constant and engaging
that I am compelled to attend strictly to
business night and day from one end of life
to the other, and have no time whatever for
observation, education, or amusement outside
of my daily tasks. As a rule, I perform my
work so noiselessly that the rest of the family
are scarcely conscious of my existence, for
when I am well everything works all right,
each organ plays its part as usual, and the
entire machinery of life is operated noiselessly
and without friction. When I am not
well, however, and am not quite equal to the
demands made upon me, I have two ways of
making it known to the family. One is by
appealing to self-consciousness through the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
assistance of my cerebro-spinal brother, with
whom I am closely associated, thereby causing
some disturbance of sensation or locomotion
(the most frequent disturbance in this
direction being the instituting of some form
of pain); or I sometimes take it into my head
to say nothing to my cerebro-spinal brother
about my affairs, but simply shirk my duties,
and my inefficiency becomes manifest only
when some one or all of the organs suffer
from some function poorly performed.”</p>

<p>The nerve-centres of the Cerebro-Spinal
System are grouped closely together, while
those of the Sympathetic System are scattered
about the body, each organ having its
appropriate centre or tiny-brain. The
heart, the liver, the kidneys, the spleen, the
brain, the intestinal tract, the bladder, the
generative organs, have each its own particular
nerve-centre of the Sympathetic System—each
its tiny-brain—each, however, connected
with all the others. And more than
this—in addition to the tiny-brains in each of
the important vital organs, there are found
scattered through the trunk a number of
<i>ganglia</i>, or knots of gray nervous matter, ar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>ranged
longitudinally in two lines extending
from just in front of the spinal column from
the base of the skull to the end of the spinal
column, each vertebra having its appropriate
ganglia. In some cases several of these ganglia
are grouped together, the number ranging
from two to three. Each ganglion is a
distinct centre giving off branches in four
directions.</p>

<p>There is also one place in which are
grouped together several very large ganglia,
forming what is known as the Solar Plexus,
or Abdominal Brain, which is situated at the
upper part of the abdomen, behind the stomach
and in front of the aorta and the pillars
of the diaphragm, and from which issue
nerves extending in all directions. By some
authorities the Solar Plexus is regarded as
the great centre of the Sympathetic System,
and the main seat of the Subconscious Mind.
Dr. Byron Robinson bestowed upon this
centre the name “The Abdominal Brain,”
saying of the use of the term: “I mean to
convey the idea that it is endowed with the
high powers and phenomena of a great ner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>vous
centre; that it can organize, multiply,
and diminish forces.”</p>

<p>One of the most interesting and significant
features of the ganglia is that of their connection
with the nerve centres of the Cerebro-Spinal
System, indicating the reciprocal
action existing between the two great nervous
systems. From each one of the ganglia
in the two great lines forming the system, issues
a tiny filament which connects with the
spinal cord; and at the same time it receives
from the spinal cord a tiny filament in return,
thus establishing a double line of communication.
It is held by some authorities
that one of these filaments acts as a sending
wire, and the other as a receiving wire between
the two systems. Be this as it may,
the inter-communication between the two systems
is clearly indicated.</p>

<p>It must be remembered that the involuntary
muscles which move the heart, as well
as the tiny muscles which form the middle-coat
of the arteries and the veins, are controlled
by the Sympathetic System, and thus
the important work of the circulation, which
goes on day and night, year in and year out,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
during life, is directly under the charge of
the Sympathetic System and the Subconscious
Mind. Also, the involuntary muscles
which are concerned with the activities of the
liver, the kidneys and the spleen, are under
the same direct control.</p>

<p>Dr. E. H. Pratt, in the “Series of Impersonations”
above referred to, makes the
“Subconscious Man” tell the following wonderful
truth, which we suggest each reader
read carefully and fix in his mind: “My
brother the Sympathetic Man has told you
that I am the animating spirit of his construction;
and as he is the great body builder,
having furnished the emotions under which
our entire family has been put into form,
you can understand by what right I pose before
you as the human form of forms. All
the rest of the family are because I am.
Even my Conscious brother, who claims superiority
to his fellow-shapes because he
bosses them around a little and makes use
of them, is a subject of my own creation....
I am the life of the Sympathetic
Man, whose existence as a human shape has
already sufficiently been well established, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
as there is no part of him which is not alive,
the conclusion is very evident that his shape
and mine are identical. <i>There is no part of
the sympathetic system which is not animated
by my own principle of vitality.</i> Indeed,
he is but a cup of life, though I can
assure you that his cup is full, and he would
not be good for much if it was not. So, if
you are able to conceive the shape of the
Sympathetic Man, you can regard this form
as identical with my own. This is really a
very modest claim on my part, and does not
quite do justice to myself, for in reality the
Sympathetic Man does not contain all there
is of me by any means, for I am not only in
him, but all around him, and he is not by any
means capable of containing my full self.”</p>

<p>When it is seen that the vital activities of
the physical body are ruled, governed and
controlled by the Sympathetic System, animated
by the Subconscious Mind, and that the
latter is amenable to Suggestion from the
Conscious Mind and from outside, we may
begin to get a glimmer of the great light
which illuminates the principle of Mental
Healing. If the Subconscious Mind, <i>the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
builder</i>, is influenced by Suggestion to neglect
his work, or to build wrongly, it is likewise
possible for him to heed proper Suggestion
and to repair his mistakes and to rebuild
properly. This principle being grasped, the
rest will seem to be merely an understanding
of the best methods of reaching the Subconscious
Mind by Suggestion or Auto-Suggestion.
We may now begin to understand
the truth of the old axiom: “As a man thinketh
in his heart, so is he”—physically. And
as Thought is based largely upon Belief, can
we not see the dynamic force of Faith? Is
there not a real psychological basis for so-called
“miracles?” Is not the wonder-working
of the cults now understandable?</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>

<p class="center">THE CELL-MINDS</p>

<p>Modern science has demonstrated that the
human body is composed of a multitude of
microscopic cells, that is, that the muscles,
nerves, tissues, blood, bones, hair and nails
are made up of minute cells, and groups of
cells. Virchow says: “It is of the cells that
the tissues are built up and the nerves
formed. There is no part of the human
body in which the cell is not seen. All these
cells are neuclated—have in them a central
life-spot like the yolk of an egg. Each cell
is born, reproduces itself, dies and is absorbed.
The maintenance of life and health
depends upon the constant regeneration of
the cells. When man can control the life and
death of the cell he becomes the creator.”
Medical science now practically asserts that
disease of the body is really disease of the
cells of which the body is composed, and that
all healing of the body must consist of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
healing of the cells—that is, of restoring the
cells to normal activity and functioning.</p>

<p>The following quotation from Hudson, following
Stephens, is interesting: “An aggregation
of cells became a confederation, with
its differentiation of cell functions and still
further division of labor. As a result of a
long process of such differentiation, the organisms
of the larger animals and of man
came to be composed, as we find them, of
thirty or more different species of cells. For
example, we have the muscle cells, whose vital
energies are devoted to the office of contraction,
or vigorous shortening of length; connective-tissue
cells, whose office is mainly to
produce and conserve a tough fibre for binding
together and covering in the organism;
bone cells, whose life work is to select and
collocate salts of lime for the organic framework,
levers and joints; hair, nail, horn and
feather cells, which work in silicates for the
protection, defense, and ornamentation of
the organism; gland cells, whose <i>motif</i> in
living has come to be the abstraction from
the blood of substances which are recombined
to produce juices needed to aid the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
various processes or steps of digestion;
blood cells, which have assumed the laborious
function of general carriers, scavengers,
and repairers of the organism; eye, ear, nasal
and palate cells, which have become the special
artificers of complicated apparatus for
transmitting light, sound, odors, and flavors
to the highly sentient brain cells; pulmonary
cells, which elaborate a tissue for the introduction
of oxygen and the elimination of
carbon dioxide and other waste products;
hepatic (liver) cells, which have, in response
to the needs of the organism, descended to
the menial office of living on the waste products
and converting them into chemical reagents
to facilitate digestion—these and
numerous other species of cells; and lastly,
most important and of greatest interest,
brain and nerve cells.”</p>

<p>The various cells of the body are constantly
busy, each performing its particular task,
either singly or in connection with other cells
in the cell-group. Like a great arm, the cells
are divided into classes, some being engaged
in the active daily work, while others are
held back on the reserve line. Some are en<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>gaged
in building up the tissues, muscles and
bones, while others are busy manufacturing
the juices, secretions, fluids and chemical
compounds required in the great laboratory
of the body. Some remain at their posts,
stationary during their entire life, while
others remain stationary only until the call
comes for their services, while a third class
are in constant motion from place to place
either following regular routes or else travelling
under a roving commission. Some of
the moving cells act as carriers of material—the
hod-carriers of the body, while others
move about doing special repair work such
as the healing of wounds, etc., while others
still are the scavengers and street cleaners of
system, and others form the cell army and
cell police force. The body has been compared
to a vast communistic or socialistic
colony, each member of which cheerfully devotes
his life-work, and often his life itself,
to the common good. The brain cells are of
course the most highly organized, and the
most highly differentiated of the cells. The
nerve cells constitute a living telegraph system
over which is carried the messages from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
the several parts of the body, each cell being
in close contact with its neighbor on each
side—the nerve cells practically clasp hands
and form a living chain of communication.</p>

<p>The blood cells are important members of
the cell-community, and are exceedingly numerous,
there being over 75,000,000,000 of the
red-blood cells alone. These red-blood cells
move in the blood currents, carrying through
the arteries each its little load of oxygen
which it transports to the distant tissues that
they may be invigorated and vitalized anew;
and, returning, carrying through the veins
the debris and waste products of the system
to the great crematory of the lungs where the
waste is burnt and thrown off from the body.
Like the ships that sail the sea, each cell
carries its outgoing cargo, and returns with
another one. Some of these cells perform
the office of special repairers, forcing their
way through the walls of the blood-vessels
and penetrating the tissues in order to perform
their special tasks. There are several
other kinds of cells in the blood besides the
carriers just mentioned. There are the wonderful
soldier and police cells which main<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>tain
order and fight battles when necessary.
The police cells are on the constant lookout
for germs, bacteria and other microscopic
disturbers of the peace of the body. When
these tiny policemen discover vagrant germs,
or criminal bacteria, they rush upon the intruder
and tying him up in a mesh, proceed
to devour him. If the intruder be too large
or vigorous, a call for assistance is sent out,
and the reserve police rush to the assistance
of their brothers and overpower the disturber
of the peace. Sometimes when the
vagrants are too numerous, the policemen
throw them out from the body, by means of
pimples, boils and similar eruptions. In case
of infectious diseases, an army corps is ordered
out in full strength and a royal fight is
waged between the invading army and the
defenders of home and country.</p>

<p>Some of the blood cells take a part in the
process of extracting from the food its nourishing
particles, and then carrying the same
through the blood-channels to all parts of the
body, where it is used to feed and nourish the
stationary cells there located. These cells
manufacture the chemical juices of the body,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
such as bile, gastric juice, pancreatic juices,
milk, etc., in short the entire physical process
is carried on by these indefatigable tiny cells.
The body of each of us is simply a great community
of cells of various kinds. The cells
are born by the form of reproduction common
to all cells, that of sub-division. Each
cell grows until a certain size is reached,
when it assumes a “dumb-bell” shape, with
a tiny waist line, which waist is afterward
dissolved and the two cells move away from
each other. In this way, and this way alone,
does the body grow, the material required for
the enlargement of the cell being supplied
from the food and nourishment partaken by
the individual. Cells die after having performed
their life-work, and their corpses are
carried through the veins by the carrier cells,
and cast into the crematory of the lungs
where they are consumed.</p>

<p>The body is constantly undergoing a process
of change and regeneration. Old cells
are being cast off every second, and new cells
are taking their places. Our muscles, tissues,
hair, nails, nerves, brain substance, and
even our bones are constantly being made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
over and rebuilt. Our bodies to-day do not
contain a single particle of the material
which composed them a few years back. A
few weeks suffices to replace our entire skin,
and a few months to replace other parts of
the body. If a sufficiently large microscope
could be placed over our bodies, we would
see each part of it as active as a hive of bees,
each cell being in action and motion, and the
entire domestic work of the human hive being
performed according to law and order. Verily,
“we are fearfully and wonderfully
made.”</p>

<p>A number of the best authorities have
used the illustration of the process of the
cells in healing an ordinary wound, in order
to show the activity and “mind” of the tiny
cells. We have become so accustomed to
the natural healing of a wound, scratch or
broken skin, that we have grown to regard
it as an almost mechanical process. But,
science shows us that there is manifested in
the healing process a marvellous degree of
life and mind in the cells. Let us consider
the process of healing an ordinary wound,
that we may see the cells at work. Let us<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
imagine that we are gazing at the wounded
part through a marvellously strong microscope
which enables us to see every cell at
work. If such a glass were provided we
should witness a scene similar to that now
to be described.</p>

<p>In the first place, through our glass, we
should see the gaping wound enlarged to gigantic
proportions. We should see the torn
skin, tissues, lymphatic and blood vessels,
glands, muscles and nerves. We would see
the blood pouring forth washing away the
dirt and foreign substances that have entered
the wound. We would then see the messages
calling for help flashing over the living telegraph
wires of the nerves, each nerve-cell
rapidly passing the word to its neighbor until
the great sympathetic centres received the
call and sounded the alarm and sent out a
“hurry up” call to the cells needed for the
repair work. In the meantime the cells of
the blood, coming in contact with the outside
air have begun to coagulate into a sticky
substance, which is the beginning of the scab,
the purpose being to close the wound and to
hold the severed parts together. The repair<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
cells having now arrived at the scene of the
accident begin to mend the break. The tissue,
nerve, and muscle cells, on each side of
the wound begin to multiply rapidly, receiving
their nourishment from the blood cells,
and quickly a cell bridge is built up until the
two severed edges of the wound are reunited.
This bridging is no haphazard process, for
the presence of directing law and order is
apparent. The newly-born cells of the blood-vessels
unite with their brothers on the other
side, evenly and in an orderly manner, new
tubular channels being formed skillfully.
The cells of the connective tissues likewise
grow toward each other, and unite in the
same orderly manner. The nerve-cells repair
their broken lines, just as do a gang of
linemen repair the interrupted telegraph system.
The muscles are united in the same
way. But mark you this, there is no mistake
in this connecting process—muscle does
not connect with nerve, nor blood-vessel with
connective tissue. Finally, the inner repairs
and connections having been completed, the
scab disappears and the cells of the outer
skin rebuild the outer covering, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
wound is healed. This process may occupy
a few hours, or many days, depending upon
the character of the wound, but the process
is the same in all cases. The surgeon merely
disinfects and cleans the wound, and placing
the parts together allows the cells to perform
their healing work, for no other power
can perform the task. The knitting together
of a broken bone proceeds along the same
lines—the surgeon places the parts in juxtaposition,
binds the limb together to prevent
slipping, and the cells do the rest.</p>

<p>When the body is well nourished, the general
system well toned up, and the mind
cheerful and active, the repair work proceeds
rapidly. But when the physical system is
run down, the body poorly nourished, and the
mind depressed and full of fear, the work is
retarded and interfered with. It is this healing
power inherent in the cells that physicians
speak of as the <i>vis vita</i> or <i>vis medicatrix
naturae</i>, or “the healing power of nature.”
Of it Dr. Patton says: “By the
term ‘efforts of nature’ we mean a certain
curative or restorative principle, or <i>vis
vita</i>, implanted in every living or organized<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
body, constantly operative for its repair,
preservation and health. This instinctive endeavor
to repair the human organism is signally
shown in the event of a severed or lost
part, as a finger, for instance; for nature unaided
will repair and fashion a stump equal
to one from the hands of an eminent surgeon....
Nature, unaided, may be equally
potent in ordinary illness. Many individuals,
even when severely ill, either from motives
of economy, prejudice, or skepticism,
remain at rest in bed, under favorable hygiene,
regimen, etc., and speedily get well
without a physician or medicine.”</p>

<p>Dr. Schofield says: “The <i>vis medicatrix
naturae</i> is a very potent factor in the amelioration
of disease, if it only be allowed fair
play. An exercise of faith, as a rule, suspends
the operation of adverse influences,
and appeals strongly through the consciousness,
to the inner and underlying faculty of
vital force (<i>i. e.</i>, unconscious mind).” Dr.
Bruce says: “We are compelled to acknowledge
a power of natural recovery inherent
in the body—a similar statement has been
made by writers on the principle of medicine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
in all ages.... The body does possess
a means and mechanism for modifying or
neutralizing influences which it cannot directly
overcome.” Oliver Wendell Holmes
says: “Whatever other theories we hold
we must recognize the ‘<i>vis medicatrix naturae</i>’
in some shape or other.” Bruce says:
“A natural power of the prevention and repair
of disorders and disease has as real and
as active an existence within us, as have the
ordinary functions of the organs themselves.”
Hippocrates said: “Nature is the physician
of diseases.” And Ambrose Pare wrote on
the walls of the great medical school, the
Ecole de Medicine of Paris, these words: “<i>Je
le ponsez et Dieu le guarit</i>,” which translated
is: “I dressed the wound, and God
healed it.”</p>

<p>It is of course true that the life and mind
in the cells is derived from the Subconscious
Mind, in fact the cells themselves may be
said to <i>embody</i> the Subconscious Mind, just
as the cells of the brain <i>embody</i> the Conscious
Mind. In every cell there is to be
found intelligence in a degree required for
the successful performance of the particular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
task of that cell. Hudson says: “All organic
tissue is made up of microscopic cells,
each one of which <i>is a living, intelligent entity</i>.”
And, again, “The subordinate intelligences
are the cells of which the whole
body is composed, <i>each of which is an intelligent
entity, endowed with powers commensurate
with its functions</i>.” In short, <i>the
cells of the body are living organs for the
expression and manifestation of the Subconscious
Mind</i>. There is not a single cell,
group, or part of the party which is devoid
of mind. Mind is imminent in the entire
body, and in its every part, down to the
smallest cell.</p>

<p>The following quotation from Dr. Thomson
J. Hudson’s “Mental Medicine” clearly
expresses a truth conceded by modern
science. Dr. Hudson says:</p>

<p>“It follows <i>a priori</i>, that every cell in the
body is endowed with intelligence; and this
is precisely what all biological science tells
us is true. Beginning with the lowest form
of animal life, the humblest cytode, every living
cell is endowed with a wonderful intelligence.
There is, in fact, no line to be drawn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
between life and mind; that is to say, every
living organism is a mind organism, from
the monera, crawling upon the bed of the
ocean, to the most highly differentiated cell
in the cerebral cortex of man. Volumes
have been written to demonstrate that ‘psychological
phenomena begin among the very
lowest class of beings; they are met with in
every form of life, from the simplest cellule
to the most complicated organism. It is they
that are the essential phenomena of life, inherent
in all protoplasm.’ (Binet.) It is,
in fact, an axiom of science that the lowest
unicellular organism is endowed with the potentialities
of manhood. I have remarked
that each living cell is endowed with a wonderful
intelligence. This is emphatically
true, whether it is a unicellular organism or
a constituent element of a multicellular organism.
Its wonderful character consists not
so much in the amount of intelligence possessed
by each individual cell, as it does in
the quality of that intelligence. That is to
say, each cell is endowed with an instinctive,
or intuitive, knowledge of all that is essential
to the preservation of its own life, the con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>servation
of its energies, and the perpetuation
of its species. In other words, it is endowed
with an intuitive knowledge of the
laws of its own being, which knowledge is
proportioned to its stage of development and
adapted to its environment.”</p>

<p>The cell has the intelligence sufficient to enable
it to seek nourishment, and to move
from one place to another in search for food
or for other purposes. It holds to its food
when secured, and envelops it until it is absorbed
and digested. It exercises the power
of choice, accepting and selecting one portion
of food in preference to another. It
has the power of discriminating between
nourishing food and the reverse. The authorities
show that it has a rudimentary
memory, and avoids the repetition of an unpleasant
or painful experience, and also
returns to the locality in which it has previously
secured food. Biological experiments
have shown that the cells are capable of experiencing
surprise, pleasure and fear, and
that they experience different degrees of feeling,
and react accordingly in response to
stimuli. Verworn, a biologist, even goes so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
far as to assert that they habitually adapt
means to ends, near and remote. In his remarkable
work on cell-life, “The Psychic
Life of Micro-organisms,” Binet says: “We
shall not regard it as strange, perhaps, to
find so complete a psychology in the history
of the lower organisms, when we call to mind
that, agreeably to the ideas of evolution now
accepted, a higher animal is nothing more
than a colony of protozoans. Every one of
the cells composing such an animal has retained
its primitive properties, giving them
a higher degree of perfection by division of
labor and by selection. The epithelial cells
that secrete the nails and hair are organisms
perfected with reference to the secretion of
protective parts. Similarly, the cells of the
brain are organisms that have been perfected
with reference to psychical attributes.”</p>

<p>Dr. Schofield says: “That life involves
mind has, of course, like all else, been vigorously
disputed and equally vigorously affirmed.
‘Life,’ says Prof. Bascom, ‘is not
force; it is combining power. <i>It is the product
and presence of mind.</i>’ ... The
extent to which the word mind may be em<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>ployed
as the inherent cause of purposive
movements in organisms is a very difficult
question to solve. There can be no doubt that
the actual agents in such movements are the
natural forces, but behind these the directing
and starting power seems to be psychic....
There being an indwelling power,
not only for purposive action in each cell,
but for endless combinations of cell activities
for common ends not at all connected
with the mere nutrition of the single cell, but
for the good of the completed organism.” Dr.
R. Dunn says: “From the first movement
when the primordial cell-germ of a human
organism comes into being, the entire individual
is present, fitted for human destiny.
From the same moment, matter, life and
mind are never for an instant separated,
their union constituting the essential work
of our present existence.” Carpenter says:
“The convertibility of physical forces and
correlation of these with the vital and the
intricacy of that nexus between mental and
bodily activity which cannot be analyzed, all
lead upwards towards one and the same conclusion—<i>the
source of all power is mind</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
And that physical conclusion is the apex
of the pyramid which has its foundation in
the primitive instincts of humanity.”</p>

<p>Having seen the evidences of life and mind
in the single cell, let us now proceed to a
consideration of the intelligence or mind inherent
and manifest in the groups of cells,
large and small, including the largest groups
which compose the several organs of the
body. This line of investigation will lead us
to a fuller understanding of the influence of
the mental states upon the health or disease
of the organs and parts. It will be seen that
Mental Healing has a sound biological as
well as a psychological basis of truth, and
that it is not necessary to invade the fields of
metaphysics or theology in order to find an
explanation of the effect of mind over body.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<p class="center">THE MENTAL BASIS OF CURE</p>

<p>We have seen that in each cell in the human
body is embodied a part of the Subconscious
Mind, sufficient in quantity and
quality to enable the cell to perform its particular
work in the physical community of
cells. In the same manner each group of
cells, large or small, is possessed of the quantity
and quality of mind adapted to the successful
performance of its particular function.
And, rising in the scale, we find that
each of the physical organs is possessed of
a “composite cell-soul” or “organ-mind.”
As Hudson says: “Each organ of the body
is composed of a group of cells which are
differentiated with special reference to the
functions to be performed by that organ. In
other words, every function of life is performed
by groups of co-operative cells, so
that the body as a whole is simply a confederation
of the various groups.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span></p>

<p>For instance, as Haeckel says: “This ‘tissue
soul’ is the higher psychological function
which gives physiological individuality to the
compound multicellular organism as a true
‘cell commonwealth.’ It controls all the separate
‘cell souls’ of the social cells—the mutually
dependent ‘citizens’ which constitute
the community.... The human egg-cell,
as soon as it is fertilized, multiplies by
division and forms a community, or colony
of many social cells. These differentiate
themselves, and by their specialization, by
various modifications of these cells, the various
tissues which compose the various organs
are developed. The developed many-celled
organisms of man and of all higher
animals resemble, therefore, a social civil
community, the numerous single individuals
of which are, indeed, developed in various
ways, but which were originally only simple
cells of one common structure.”</p>

<p>Biology shows us that there are unquestionably
methods of communication between
cell and cell, although it has not as yet been
definitely determined just how this communication
is effected. In the cell-communities<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
of the micro-organisms there is undoubtedly
present the power to communicate on the
part of the several cells composing the community,
and the pain or discomfort of one
part is evidently felt by the whole community.
Just as an army, or a congregation, has a
mind common to the whole, in addition to the
individual minds of its units, so has every organ
of the body an “organ mind” in addition
to the individual cell minds of its unit cells.
The fact of the existence of “group-mind,”
or “collective-mind” is recognized by the
best authorities in modern psychology, and
the study of its principles throws light on
some hitherto perplexing phenomena.</p>

<p>Prof. Le Bon, in his work “The Crowd,”
says of the “collective mind” of men: “The
sentiments and ideas of all the persons in the
gathering take one and the same direction,
and their conscious personality vanishes. A
collective mind is formed, doubtless transitory,
but presenting very clearly marked
characteristics. The gathering has become
what, in the absence of a better expression,
I will call an organized crowd, or, if the term
be considered preferable, a psychological<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
crowd. <i>It forms a single being</i>, and is subjected
to the law of the mental unity of
crowds.... The most striking peculiarity
presented by a psychological crowd
is the following: Whoever be the individuals
that compose it, however like or unlike be
their mode of life, their occupation, their
character, or their intelligence, the fact that
they have been transformed into a crowd
puts them in possession of <i>a sort of collective
mind</i>, which makes them feel, think, and act
in a manner quite different from that in
which each individual of them would feel,
think and act, were he in a state of isolation.
There are certain ideas and feelings which
do not come into being, or do not transform
themselves into acts, except in the case of
the individuals forming a crowd....
In the collective mind the intellectual aptitudes
of the individuals, and in consequence
their individuality, is weakened....
The most careful observations seem to prove
that an individual immerged for some length
of time in a crowd in action soon finds itself
in a special state, which most resembles the
state of fascination in which the hypnotized<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
individual finds himself.... The conscious
personality has entirely vanished, will
and discernment are lost. All feelings and
thoughts are bent in the direction determined
by the hypnotizer.... An individual in
a crowd is a grain of sand amid other grains
of sand, which the wind stirs up at will.”</p>

<p>In short, psychology recognizes a <i>mental
fusion</i> between the individual minds of units
composing a community of cells, insects,
higher animals and even men. The “spirit
of the hive” noted by all students of bee-life,
and the community spirit in an ant-hill are
instances serving to illustrate the general
principle of “the collective mind.” As we
have seen in the preceding chapter, the entire
human body is a vast community of cells,
each unit in the community having relations
with every other unit, and all having sprung
from the same original egg-cell. This great
community, or <i>nation</i> of cells is divided into
many smaller communities, chief among
which are the principal organs of the body,
as the stomach, the intestines, the liver, the
kidneys, the spleen, the heart, etc. And, following
the general rule, each of these organ-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>communities
possesses its own “collective
mind,” subordinate, of course, to the great
community mind known as the Subconscious
Mind. Ordinarily these communities live in
peace and harmony, and in obedience to the
national government. But occasionally rebellions
and revolutions are started, which
cause much inharmony, pain and disease.
Sometimes these rebellions arise from abuse
of the particular organ by its owner, or from
sympathy with another abused organ, or
from general abuse of the system. But, at
other times, there seems to be an active discontent
springing up in an organ, to the quelling
of which the entire Subconscious Mind
bends its energy and forces. Very often
these rebellions are started by adverse auto-suggestions
or fearthoughts emanating from
the conscious mind of the individual, which
act according to the law of suggestion and
practically <i>hypnotize</i> the mind of the organ
in question.</p>

<p>This idea of each organ having a mind of
its own—being practically an entity, in fact—may
be somewhat startling to those who have
never had the matter presented to them, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
the statement is backed up by the best scientific
authorities who, however, do not usually
state it in so plain terms, or popular form.
It is likely that the science of the future will
make some great discoveries regarding this
matter of the “collective mind” of the organs,
and that the schools of medicine will
adapt the new knowledge to the treatment of
disease. In the meantime, the practitioners
of Mental Healing are availing themselves of
this principle, often without realizing the
principle itself.</p>

<p>The writer has been interested in this subject
of the “organ mind” for a number of
years, and has conducted a number of experiments
along this line, the result being that he
feels more firmly convinced each year of the
truth of the theory or idea. He has found
that mental treatments based on this theory
have been very successful, much more so in
fact than those conducted in pursuance to
other theories. It seems that by applying the
suggestive treatment direct to the affected
organ a quicker response is had. The writer
is indebted to Dr. Paul Edwards, a well
known mental healer, who several years ago<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
advanced the idea that the mind or “intelligence”
in the several organs differed greatly
in temperament and quality. He informed
us that he had proven to his own satisfaction
that the heart is “<i>very</i> intelligent,” and
quite amenable to mild, gentle, coaxing suggestions,
advice or orders; while, on the
other hand, the liver is a most mulish, stubborn,
obstinate organ-mind, which requires
one to drive it in a sharp positive manner.
Investigation along these lines suggested by
Dr. Edwards has convinced the writer that
the theory is warranted by the facts. Experiments
have shown that the heart organ-mind
is gentle, mild, and easily influenced by
kindly suggestion, advice and requests, and
that it needs but a word directed to it to attract
its attention. Likewise, the liver has
been found to be brutish, stubborn and obstinate,
needing the most vigorous suggestions—in
short the liver-mind is a donkey
and must be so treated. The liver-mind is
sluggish, torpid and sleepy, and needs much
prodding before it will “sit up and take notice.”
The stomach has been found to be
quite intelligent, especially when it has not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
been brutalized by “stuffing.” It will readily
respond to suggestive treatment of all kinds,
it being noticed that it may be easily flattered
or “jollied” into good behavior, just
as may certain children. The nervous system
has a mind of its own, and will accept
suggestions, although it is usually difficult
to attract its attention, owing to its habit of
concentration upon its regular work. The
bowel-mind will respond to firm, kind treatment,
as will also the uterus-mind and the
mind controlling the other organs peculiar
to women.</p>

<p>In another work, the writer has said regarding
this form of treatment of the organs
through their organ-minds: “Remember,
always, that you are mind talking to mind,
not to dead matter. There is mind in every
cell, nerve, organ and part of the body, and
in the body as a whole, and this mind will
listen to your central mind and obey it, because
your central mind is positive to it—the
organ is negative to <i>you</i>. Carry this
idea with you in giving these treatments, and
endeavor to visualize the mind in the organs,
as clearly as may be, for by so doing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
you get them in better <i>rapport</i> with you, and
can handle them to better advantage. And
always remember that the virtue lies not in
the mere sound of the words that happen to
reach the organ or cells—they do not understand
words as words, but they do understand
the meaning behind the words. But
without words it is very hard for you to
think, or clearly express the feeling—and
so, by all means use the words just as if the
organ-mind understood the actual meaning
thereof, for by so doing you can drive in the
meaning of the word—and induce the mental
state and conditions necessary to work
the cure.</p>

<p>Dr. S. F. Meacham, in a magazine article
published several years ago, said: “Let me
once more call your attention to that one
great principle of disease and cure. It is
the only medical creed I hold to-day and will
bear repeating, lest we neglect it. <i>Disease
is a failure of the cells to make good their
waste, or to do their full duty.</i> This may be
an individual matter with the cell, or may
result from imperfect co-operation; there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
may be a mutiny in the co-operative commonwealth
constituting the body. Apart
from all mutual help, or co-operation of cells,
each individual cell must either do its full
duty, or suffer, and perchance die, as the
result. Remember that each individual cell
lives, and has an office that no other cell can
fill to save it. If the other cell does the work,
it will live, but the failing cell will not profit
thereby. By co-operating they may lighten
each other’s labors, but <i>no cell is or can be
exempt from doing its part</i>. Any failure of
this kind is disease either local or general,
according to the degree and nature of the
failure, or according to the importance of
the mutinous or weakened cell. A cure results
when the cells again do their work. Or,
if a certain number die, a cure is established
when other cells learn to do that particular
work, which is sometimes the case. A remedy
is any substance, or force, or procedure
that will stimulate, or help, or remove obstacles
that prevent these cells from doing their
work. <i>Keep in mind, that the life process
acting through or in the cell does the work
either aided, or alone.</i> The lesson then is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
that all these methods do good, and that owing
to the view point, mental status, or expectancy
of the individual, now one and now
another method will appeal to him and be
accepted. No matter what we do, we aid,
we assist only—we do not cure....
<i>The process going on in each cell is an intelligent
one</i>, and all extrinsic methods are
really but suggestions offered to the cell,
the real worker; and the fact is that any one
of these helps may be chosen, and all may
be rejected....”</p>

<p>“The repair of a cell is as equally as intellectual
a process as any other can be. If,
for instance, blind force can repair one cell,
it can many; if it can build one, it can all,
and mind and intellect are then without
causal efficacy, without spontaneity, and
blind force, fatality and purposeless action
reign supreme.... According to this
theory the building and repairing of cells
would not be intellectual, as there would be
no working plan or purpose. I am aware
that a purely extrinsic study of the cells
and of the body will force this conclusion
upon any candid, unprejudiced mind; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
<i>a study from the inside</i> is a different matter.
A cell, looked at from without, moves
only when stimulated; but is this really true?
The body is but a compound of cells when
viewed from the outside; then if one cell
moves when stimulated, why not twenty, a
hundred, a thousand, a billion, the entire
body? But is it true of the body? You
come to me and propose some scheme, or act,
which I carry out. Now is your proposition
the real cause of my act, or only a condition?
Do I not choose, and either do the thing or
not, as determined from within? If this is
true of the body, why not of the cell? May
not the stimulation we see be a condition
only, and the real cause of the act be within
the cell itself?... The cell is not a
mere machine, <i>but a living entity</i>, doing
everything that the body does. It eats,
drinks, moves, reproduces its kind, selects
its food, repairs its waste, etc. These are
intellectual processes, but may not be
conscious....</p>

<p>“The cure consists in the repairing of
the wasted tissue, and in the cells restoring
and repairing themselves into a definite pat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>tern,
necessary to mutual work, so that the
commonwealth may prosper. Air, water, sunshine,
food, etc., are necessary to the performance
of this work of repair. When
these are furnished, even under the best conditions
possible, the cells must use them to
build up the waste, and this they do by their
internal forces. But this process is what is
called repair on the one hand, and cure on
the other. External means may be essential,
but that will not make them really curative....
It is well, also, to keep in mind that
external in the true sense of the term as
we are using it here. <i>Any force outside of
the diseased cell is an external force to that
cell even if it be thought-force.</i> Disease is
always treated by external force, external as
defined above, and all disease is just as
surely cured by internal force—viz.: <i>force
resident in the cell itself</i>. Here we all stand
around the suffering cell, one with drug-power
in his hand, another with electricity,
or water, or heat, or directed attention—thought-force
or more nourishment which
necessitates a better circulation to that area,
or some other of the thousand therapeutic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
measures, and we are close enough together
at last to see that we are simply using different
stimuli to try to aid the real worker
within the cell to do his work by furnishing,
not only material that is necessary, but force
as well, that out of the abundance his work
may be easy and rapid.”</p>

<p>The reader who will consider the numerous
instances of cure by Suggestion or
Faith-Cure, as noted in the following chapters,
will be better able to understand the
principle underlying these cures if he will
realize the fact brought out so forcibly by
Dr. Meacham, as above quoted. The attention
of the patient being directed to the organ
affected, in connection with the stimulating
and vitalizing effect of Faith and Belief,
starts into renewed activity the cell-mind
of the organ in question, and arouses
its reparative and recuperative energies.
Each organ, and its component cells and cell-groups,
is of course under the control of the
Subconscious Mind, and forms a part of the
material embodiment thereof. The Subconscious
Mind, being stimulated by the Suggestion
and Faith, and having its Expectant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
Attention aroused, concentrates its energies
upon the reparative and recuperative processes
in the organ, and the work of cure proceeds.
The cure, in every case, is simply
either repair work, or else the restoration
of normal functioning—in either case the
cells themselves doing the work.</p>

<p>In the consideration of the reasons underlying
the cure of disease by Psycho-Therapeutics,
we must first consider the question
of what disease really is. And in this phase
of the consideration, it will be well for us to
first dispel the erroneous ideas concerning
disease which we have been entertaining.
Perhaps the following striking statement
from Sidney Murphy, M. D., printed in the
magazine “Suggestion” several years ago,
may help you to form a correct idea of the
nature of disease, or rather a correct idea
of what disease <i>is not</i>. Dr. Murphy says, in
the said article, among other things: “Prof.
S. D. Gross, formerly of the New York University
Medical School, says: ‘Of the essence
of disease very little is known—indeed
nothing at all.’ Nevertheless it is evident<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
that medical men have an idea on the subject.
The theory generally held, I believe,
is that disease is destructive action; but just
what this means, whether destructive action
on the part of vitality itself, or by something
acting upon the vitality, is not so clear; but
we are enabled to gain some light by reference
to the expression used in medical books concerning
it. Thus we find that disease ‘attacks
us,’ that it ‘seats itself in an organ,’
that ‘it works through us, runs its course,’
etc. It is also said to be ‘very malignant,’
or ‘quite mild,’ ‘persistently resisting all
treatment,’ or ‘yielding readily’ to it. In
fact, it is considered an entity, possessing
character and disposition and general vital
qualities—a something which domiciles itself
in the vital domain, and exercises its
forces to the destruction of the vital powers.
It is indeed spoken of as one would speak of
a rat in his granary, or a mouse in his cupboard,
and efforts are made to dislodge it,
or kill it, as one would dislodge or kill any
other living thing. This theory of disease
is beginning to be looked upon even by the
medical world as untenable. Living things<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
are always possessed of organizations having
form or shape; and hence if disease were
such, its form would be discerned and described;
a thing which never has been done.
Disease by our ancestors was considered a
subtile and mysterious thing which pounced
down upon us, and runs its course without any
reference to causes; and language being
formed to convey this idea, it has been transmitted
almost unchanged from generation
to generation down to the present time. And
the medical profession of to-day is simply
an embodiment of that idea. It is probable
that the term ‘destructive action’ is generally
held to mean destructive action on the
part of the vitality itself.... Life in
organic form is developed according to law.
Slowly rising into power, organization at
length reaches its zenith, and then goes down
the gentle declivity, until the soul steps off
into the great beyond, without pain or struggle,
provided always that the conditions of
life are natural and therefore favorable; but
if these be unfavorable, unfavorable results
must of course follow; vitality, nevertheless,
doing the best it can under the circum<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>stances
to preserve the normal state of the
body. Disease, we propose to show, is not
antagonistic to vital action, but the opposite,
a remedial effort, <i>or vital action on the
defensive</i>. It is not a downward tendency,
nor the result of a downward tendency on
the part of a living organism, but is itself
an upward or self-preservative tendency, the
result of disobedience to natural laws. <i>It
is simply abnormal action, because of abnormal
conditions.</i>”</p>

<p>In considering the above revolutionary
statement of Dr. Murphy, we must remember
that “vitality” or “vital force” is simply
the action of the Subconscious Mind
operating through the sympathetic system,
the organ-minds, and the cell-minds. <i>All
vital energy, at the last is mental energy.</i>
And, we must also remember that the “abnormal
conditions” which Dr. Murphy
speaks of as being the cause of “abnormal
action” or disease, are not confined alone to
physical or material conditions, but also to
abnormal mental conditions, such as fear-thought,
adverse suggestions, improper use
of the imagination, etc. As we have seen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
in the preceding chapters, the causes of disease
may be mental as well as material or
physical.</p>

<p>The Subconscious Mind in its vital activities
is constantly at work building up, repairing,
growing, nourishing, supporting
and regulating the body, doing its best to
throw off abnormal conditions, and seeking
to do the best it can when these conditions
cannot be removed. With its source pure and
unpolluted the stream of vitality flows on
unhindered, but when the poison of fear-thought,
adverse suggestion and false belief
is poured into the source or spring from
which the stream rises, it follows that the
waters of life will no longer be pure and
clear. Let us notice the general direction of
the vital activities of the Subconscious Mind.</p>

<p>In the first place we find that the vital activities
are primarily concerned with <i>self-preservation</i>,
that is with the preservation
of the individual and the race. One has but
to notice the ever-present manifestation of
the “race instinct” which draws the males
and females of the several species together,
that they may mate and bring forth the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
young needed to keep alive the species. The
parental devotions, with its many sacrifices
of personal pleasure for the young, are instances
ever before us. And no less striking
is the companion activities which make
for the preservation of the individual. The
instinctive tendency toward self-preservation
is so strong that it overpowers the reason
in the majority of cases. Men may decry
the value of life, but let their life be
threatened and the instinctive protective
feeling causes them to fight for life against
all odds. “All that a man hath will he give
for his life.” And this instinctive activity
is manifest not only in the individual as a
whole, but in every cell of his body. Every
cell is striving hard for the welfare of the
community of which it forms a part. Even
in disease it strives to throw off the abnormal
conditions which afflict the body, and
failing to do so it hobbles along doing the
best it can under the circumstances.</p>

<p>The tiny seed sprouting in the ground,
and lifting weights a thousand times that of
itself, shows the self-preservative energies
and activities of the mind principle within<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
it. The healing work of the cells in the case
of a wound, or of a broken bone, as described
elsewhere in this book, gives us another example.
The healing efforts of the organism
striving to throw off the morbid substances
within the body, purging them away in a
flux, or burning them up with a fever, show
the operations of the same principle. This,
we have seen, is called the <i>vis medicatrix naturae</i>,
or “healing power of nature,” which
operates in man as well as in the case of the
lower animals—but it is really but the operations
of the great Subconscious Mind of the
individual. As Dr. Murphy, previously
quoted, says: “Certainly all experience declares
and all physicians will admit that
where vital power is abundant in a man he
will get well from almost any injuries short
of complete destruction of vital organs; but
where vitality is low, recovery is much more
difficult, if not impossible, which can only
be explained on the principle that vitality
always works upward toward life and health
to the extent of its ability under the circumstances,
because, if it worked downward, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
less vitality, the more surely and speedily
would death result.”</p>

<p>Following the law of self-preservation, we
find that of <i>accommodation</i> manifesting itself
in the vital activities of the Subconscious
Mind. This principle or law works in the
direction of <i>adjusting the organism to conditions
which it cannot remedy</i>. Thus a sapling
bent out of shape, will bend its branches
upward until once more they will reach toward
the sky notwithstanding the deformed
trunk. Seed sprouting from a narrow crevice
in a rock, and unable to split the rock,
will assume a deformed shape but will hold
tenaciously to life, and will thrive under
these abnormal conditions. This principle
of accommodation acts upon the idea of “life
at any price,” and of “making the best of
things.” Man and the lower animals accommodate
themselves to their environment,
when they are unable to overcome the unsatisfactory
conditions of the latter. The
study of anthropology, natural history, and
botany will convince anyone that the principle
of accommodation is everywhere present
in connection with that of self-preserva<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>tion.
And the diseased conditions, and
abnormal functioning, which we find in cases
of chronic diseases is simply the principle
of accommodation in the vital activities of
the Subconscious Mind, but which it is “trying
to make the best of it,” and holding
on to “life at any price.”</p>

<p>Dr. Murphy, previously quoted, says:
“Disease, in its essential nature, has a
deeper significance than simply abnormal
manifestations. It is really a remedial effort,
not necessarily successful, but an attempt
to change, or have changed existing
conditions. And for this reason any improper
relation of the living organism to
external agents necessarily results in an injury
to that organism, which by virtue of its
being self-preservative, immediately sets up
defensive action, and begins as soon as possible
to repair the damages that have accrued.
This defensive or reparative action,
of course, corresponds to the conditions to
be corrected, and hence is abnormal and diseased;
and its severity and persistence will
depend upon the damages to be repaired,
and the intensity and persistence of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
causes that produced it. Serious injury
present or impending will demand serious
vital action; desperate conditions, desperate
action. But in all cases the action is
vital, an attempt at restoration, and the energy
displayed will exactly correspond to
the interests involved and the vitality that
is available.”</p>

<p>From the above, and from what has been
shown in previous chapters, it will be seen
that just as is health the result of the normal
functioning of the Subconscious Mind,
so is disease the result of its abnormal
functioning. And it may also be seen that
the true healing power must come alone from
and through the Subconscious Mind itself,
although the same may be aroused, awakened
and directed by various outside agencies.
As Dr. Thomson J. Hudson says:
“Granted that there is an intelligence that
controls the functions of the body in health,
it follows that it is the same power or energy
that fails in case of disease. Failing,
it requires assistance; and that is what all
therapeutic agencies aim to accomplish. No
intelligent physician of any school claims<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
to be able to do more than to ‘assist nature’
to restore normal conditions of the body.
That it is a mental energy that thus requires
assistance, no one denies; for science teaches
us that the whole body is made up of a confederation
of intelligent entities, each of
which performs its functions with an intelligence
exactly adapted to the performance of
its special duties as a member of the confederacy.
There is, indeed, no life without
mind, from the lowest unicellular organism
up to man. <i>It is therefore a mental energy
that actuates every fiber of the body under
all its conditions. That there is a central intelligence
that controls each of these mind
organisms, is self-evident....</i> It is
sufficient for us to know that such an intelligence
exists, and that, for the time being,
it is the controlling energy that normally
regulates the action of the myriad cells of
which the body is composed. <i>It is, then, a
mental organism that all therapeutic
agencies are designed to energize, when, for
any cause, it fails to perform its functions
with reference to any part of the physical
structure.</i>”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>

<p class="center">THE HISTORY OF PSYCHO-THERAPY</p>

<p>One of the most remarkable achievements
of the New Psychology is that of gathering
up the scattered instances of the effect of
the power of the mind over the body, under
the various masks and guises worn during
the ages, and uniting them in one broad and
general synthesis in which is to be seen the
one fundamental principle of Mental Healing
operating under a thousand names,
forms and theories, in every race, nation
and clime in all ages past and present. The
New Psychology is the great reconciler of
the various theories, dogmas and speculations
concerned with the subject of the
strange cures effected by the mind, as well as
with the equally strange adverse effect upon
the physical organism of negative thoughts.</p>

<p>From the earliest days of history we find
records of strange and marvelous cures effected
by non-material agents. In some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
cases the effect is attributed to magical
power, while in others, and the majority of
cases, the cure is attributed to some particular
religious belief, creed or ceremony. Not
only in the folk-lore of the several races, and
in their general traditions, but also in the
written and graven record do we find traces
of the universality of the principle of mental
therapeutics.</p>

<p>H. Addington Bruce says: “Psychotherapy
might well be cited in support of
the old adage that there is nothing new but
what has been forgotten. Traces of it are to
be found almost as far back as authentic history
extends, and even allusion to methods
which bear a strong resemblance to those of
modern times. The literature and monumental
remains of ancient Egypt, Greece,
Rome, Persia, India and China reveal a
widespread knowledge of hypnotism and its
therapeutic value. There is in the British
Museum a bas-relief from Thebes which has
been interpreted as representing a physician
hypnotizing a patient by making ‘passes’
over him. According to the Ebers papyrus,
the ‘laying on of hands’ formed a prominent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
feature of Egyptian medical practice as
early as 1552 B. C., or nearly thirty-five hundred
years ago; and it is known that a similar
mode of treatment was employed by
priests of Chaldea in ministering to the sick.
So, also, the priests of the famous Temples
of Health are credited with having worked
numerous cures by the mere touch of the
hands. In connection with these same
Temples of Health were sleeping chambers,
repose in which was supposed to be exceptionally
beneficial. Asclepiades of Bithynia,
who won considerable fame at Rome as a
physician, systematically made use of the
‘induced trance’ in the treatment of certain
diseases. Plautus, Martial, and Seneca refer
in their writings to some mysterious
process of manipulation which had the same
effect—that is, of putting persons into an artificial
sleep. And Solon sang, apparently,
of some form of mesmeric cure:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">“‘The smallest hurts sometimes increase and rage</div>
<div class="line i1">More than all art of physic can assuage;</div>
<div class="line i1">Sometimes the fury of the worst disease</div>
<div class="line i1">The hand by gentle stroking, will appease.’</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>“Many other instances might be men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>tioned
testifying to the remarkable extent to
which psycho-therapy, in one form or another,
was utilized in the countries of the
ancient world. This, of course, does not
necessarily imply that the ancients had any
real understanding of the psychological and
physiological principles governing its operation.
On the contrary, there is every reason
to believe that they used it much as do
too many of the mental healers of to-day—on
the basis of ‘faith cure’ pure and simple,
with no attempt at diagnosis, and in a hit-or-miss
fashion. It was not until the very
end of the Middle Ages, so far as history informs
us, that anything even remotely resembling
a scientific inquiry into its nature
and possibilities was undertaken, and then
only in a faint, vague, indefinite way, by
men who were metaphysicians and mystics
rather than scientists. The first of these,
Petrys Pomponatius, a sixteenth-century
philosopher, sought to prove that disease
was curable without drugs, by means of the
‘magnetism’ existing in certain specially
gifted individuals. ‘When those who are endowed
with this faculty,’ he affirmed, ‘oper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>ate
by employing the force of the imagination
and the will, this force affects their
blood and their spirits, which produce the
intended effects by means of an evaporation
thrown outwards.’ Following Pomponatius,
John Baptist von Helmont, to whom medical
science owes a great deal, also proclaimed
the curative virtue of magnetism, which he
described as an invisible fluid called forth
and directed by the influence of the human
will. Other writers, notably Sir Kenelm
Digby, laid stress on the power of the imagination
as an agent in the cause as well as
the cure of disease, compiling in a curious
little treatise published in 1658, as interesting
a collection of illustrative cases as is
contained in the literature of modern psycho-therapy.”</p>

<p>In the Middle Ages, we read that there
were many instances of miraculous cures effected
at the various shrines of the saints,
and in the churches in which were exhibited
the bones and other relics of the holy people
of church history. As Dr. George R.
Patton says: “A word scrawled upon parchment,
for instance, would cure fevers; an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
hexameter from the Iliad of Homer cured
gout, while rheumatism succumbed to a verse
from Lamentations. These could be multiplied,
and undoubtedly all were equally potent
of cure in like manner.... At one
time holy wells were to be found in almost
every parish of Ireland, to which wearisome
journeys were made for the miraculous powers
of cure. It was the custom of the cured
to hang upon the bushes contiguous to the
springs small fragments of their clothing, or
a cane, or a crutch as a memento of cure, so
that from afar the springs could be easily
located by the many colored fragments of
clothing, rags, canes and crutches swayed
upon the branches by the wind. Inasmuch
as the bushes for many rods around were
thus adorned, the cures must have been far
from few.”</p>

<p>In the Middle Ages it was the custom of
persons afflicted with scrofula and kindred
disorders to come before the king upon certain
days to receive the “Royal Touch,” or
laying-on-of-hands which was held to be an
infallible specific for the disease. The cus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>tom
was instituted by Edward the Confessor,
and continued until the accession to
power of the house of Brunswick. It is a
matter of history that many persons were
cured by the touch of the king’s hands.
Wiseman, a celebrated surgeon and physician
of old London testifies as follows: “I
myself have been an eye-witness of many
thousands of cures performed by his majesty’s
touch alone, without any assistance of
medicine or surgery, and those, many of
them, such as had tired out the endeavors
of able surgeons before they came hither....
I must needs profess that what I
write will little more than show the weakness
of our ability when compared with his
majesty’s, who cureth more in one year than
all the surgeons of London have done in an
age.” The virtue of the “King’s Touch”
was finally brought in doubt by the wonderful
successes of a man by the name of Valentine
Greatrakes, who in the Seventeenth Century
began “laying on hands” and made
even more wonderful cures than those of the
king. So marked was his success that the
government had difficulty in suppressing the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
growing conviction among the common people
that Greatrakes must be of royal blood,
and the rightful heir to the throne, because
of the great healing virtues of his hands,
which, they argued, could be possessed only
by those having royal blood in their veins.
The Chirurgical Society of London investigated
Greatrakes’ cures, and rendered an
opinion that he healed by virtue of “some
mysterious sanative contagion in his body.”</p>

<p>But perhaps the most notable figure in the
European history of Mental Healing was
Franz Anton Mesmer, a native of Switzerland,
who was born in 1734, and who later
in the century created the greatest excitement
in several European countries by his
strange theories and miraculous claims.
Frank Podmore in a recent work says of
Mesmer: “He had no pretensions to be a
thinker; he stole his philosophy ready-made
from a few belated alchemists; and his entire
system of healing was based on a delusion.
His extraordinary success was due to
the lucky accident of the times. Mesmer’s
first claim to our remembrance lies in this—that
he wrested the privilege of healing from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
the churches and gave it to mankind as a
universal possession.”</p>

<p>Mesmer held that there was in Nature a
universal magnetic force which had a powerful
therapeutic effect when properly applied.
He cured many people by touching
them with an iron rod, through which he
claimed the universal magnetism flowed
from his body to that of the patient. He
called this magnetic fluid “animal magnetism.”
Later on he devised his celebrated
“magnetic tub” or <i>baquet</i>, by means of
which he was able to treat his patients <i>en
masse</i>. Podmore gives the following interesting
account of scenes surrounding his
treatments:</p>

<p>“The baquet was a large oaken tub, four
or five feet in diameter and a foot or more
in depth, closed by a wooden cover. Inside
the tub were placed bottles full of water disposed
in rows radiating from the center, the
necks in some of the rows pointing towards
the center, in others away from it. All these
bottles had been previously ‘magnetized’ by
Mesmer. Sometimes there were several
rows of bottles, one above the other; the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
machine was then said to be at high pressure.
The bottles rested on layers of powdered
glass and iron filings. The tub itself
was filled with water. The whole machine,
it will be seen, was a kind of travesty of the
galvanic cell. To carry out the resemblance,
the cover of the tub was pierced with holes,
through which passed slender iron rods of
varying lengths, which were jointed and
movable, so that they could be readily applied
to any part of the patient’s body.
Round this battery the patients were seated
in a circle, each with his iron rod. Further,
a cord, attached at one end to the tub, was
passed round the body of each of the sitters,
so as to bind them all into a chain. Outside
the first a second circle would frequently
be formed, who would connect themselves
together by holding hands. Mesmer,
in a lilac robe, and his assistant operators—vigorous
and handsome young men selected
for the purpose—walked about the room,
pointing their fingers or an iron rod held in
their hands at the diseased parts.”</p>

<p>Mesmer made many wonderful cures, and
attracted wide attention. In 1781 the king<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
of France offered him a pension of thirty
thousand livres if he would make public his
secret. The offer was refused, but he gave
private instruction and opened a school.
He had many pupils and followers, prominent
among whom was the Marquis de Puysegur,
who made discoveries resulting in the
identification of Mesmerism with the “trance
condition” now commonly associated with
the term, whereas originally Mesmerism included
simply the healing process. Mesmer’s
methods continued popular for many
years after his death, until Braid’s work resulted
in the founding of the modern school
of Hypnotism, and Mesmerism died out.</p>

<p>The Abbe Faria, about 1815, after investigating
Mesmerism and attracting much attention,
discarded the “fluidic” theory of
Mesmer, and held, instead, that in order to
induce the mesmeric state and to produce the
phenomena thereof, it was necessary merely
to create a mental state of “expectant attention”
on the part of the patient. The
cause of the state and the phenomena, he
held, was not in the operator but in the
mind of the patient—purely subjective, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
fact. Alexander Bertrand, a Frenchman,
published a work about this time, holding
theories similar to those of Faria. In 1841
James Braid, an English physician, becoming
interested in Mesmerism, discovered that
the mesmeric state might be artificially induced
by staring at bright objects until the
eyes became fatigued, etc., and, later, that
any method whereby concentration and “expectant
attention” might be induced would
produce the phenomenon. He duplicated all
the feats of the mesmerists, including the
healing of diseases. He called his new system
“Hypnotism” to distinguish it from
Mesmerism, and under its new name it
gained favor among the medical fraternity.
Moreover, in connection with his predecessors,
Faria and Bertrand, he laid the basis
for the modern theories of Suggestive
Therapeutics.</p>

<p>Shortly after Braid’s death, in 1860, Dr.
A. A. Liebault, a French physician, established
his since famous School of Nancy, in
which during the after years the later wonderful
discoveries in Suggestive Therapeutics
were made. He used the methods of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
hypnotism, but Suggestion was ever the operative
principle recognized and applied.
Liebault said: “It is all a matter of Suggestion.
My patients are <i>suggested</i> to sleep,
and their ills are <i>suggested</i> out of them. It
is very simple, once you understand the laws
of Suggestion.” Dr. Charcot, in his celebrated
clinic in the Salpetriere, in Paris,
did great work along the same general lines,
although proceeding under somewhat different
theories. Following the example of
these and other eminent authorities, the
medical fraternity has gradually adopted
many of the ideas of Suggestive Therapeutics,
and to-day many of the best medical
schools throughout this country and
Europe give instruction in this branch of
healing. Many books have been written on
the subject by eminent medical authorities,
and the indications are that during the present
century Suggestive Therapeutics, in its
various forms, will come even more prominently
into popular favor, and that it will
be developed far beyond its present limits.
Experimental work along these lines is now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
being conducted in many psychological laboratories
in our great universities.</p>

<p>At the same time, as we shall now see,
Mental Healing has been attracting much attention
along other lines, outside of the
medical profession, and often allied with religious
and metaphysical movements. To
understand the subject, we must study it in
all of its phases.</p>

<p>In the early part of the nineteenth century
Elijah Perkins, an ignorant blacksmith living
in Connecticut conceived a queer idea of
curing disease by means of a peculiar pair
of tongs manufactured by himself, one prong
being of brass and the other of steel. These
tongs were called “tractors,” and were applied
to the body of the patient in the region
affected by disease, the body being stroked
in a downward direction for a period of
about ten minutes. The tractors were used
to treat all manner of complaints, ailments
and diseases, internal and external, with a
wonderful degree of success. Almost miraculous
cures of all manner of complaints
were reported, and people flocked to Per<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>kins
from far and near in order to receive
the benefit of his wonderful treatments.</p>

<p>Soon this system of healing came to be
called “Perkinsism,” as a tribute to the inventor.
The popularity of the system spread
rapidly in the United States, particularly in
New England, every city and many towns
patronizing Perkins’ practitioners and healers.
From this country the craze spread to
Great Britain, and even to the Continent.
Centers of treatment, and even hospitals,
were established by the “Perkinsites,” and
the fame of the tractors increased daily in
ever widening circles. In Europe alone it
is reported that over 1,500,000 cures were
performed, and the medical fraternity were
at their wit’s ends to explain the phenomenon.
Finally, Dr. Haygarth, of London,
conceived the idea that the real virtue of
the cures was vested in the minds, belief and
imagination of the patients rather than in
the tractors, and that the cures were the result
of the induced mental states of the patients
instead of by the metallic qualities of
the apparatus. He determined to investigate
the matter under this hypothesis, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
accordingly constructed a pair of tractors of
wood, painted to resemble the genuine ones.
The following account by Bostock describes
the result: “He accordingly formed pieces
of wood into the shape of tractors and with
much assumed pomp and ceremony applied
them to a number of sick persons who had
been previously prepared to expect something
extraordinary. The effects were found
to be astonishing. Obstinate pains in the
limbs were suddenly cured; joints that had
long been immovable were restored to motion,
and, in short, except the renewal of lost
parts or the change in mechanical structure,
nothing seemed beyond their power to accomplish.”
The exposure of this experiment,
and the general acceptance of the explanation
of the phenomena, caused “Perkinsism”
to die out rapidly, and at the present
time it is heard of only in connection
with the history of medicine and in the pages
of works devoted to the subject of the effect
of the mind over the body.</p>

<p>The success of “Perkinsism” is but a
typical instance which is duplicated every
twenty years or so by the rapid rise, spread<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
and then rapid decline of some new “craze”
in healing, all of which, when investigated
are seen to be but new examples of the power
of the mental states of faith and imagination
upon the physical organism. The well-known
“blue glass” craze of about thirty-five
years ago gives us another interesting
example. General Pleasanton, a well-known
and prominent citizen of Philadelphia, announced
his discovery that the rays of the
sun passing through the medium of blue
glass possessed a wonderful therapeutic
value. The idea fired the public imagination
at once, and the General’s book met with a
large sale. Everyone, seemingly, began to
experiment with the blue glass rays. Windows
were fitted with blue glass panes, and
the patients sat so that the sun’s rays might
fall upon them after passing through the
blue panes. Wonderful cures were reported
from all directions, the results of “Perkinsism”
being duplicated in almost every detail.
Even cripples reported cures, and
many chronic and “incurable” cases were
healed almost instantaneously. Bedridden
people threw aside their blankets and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
walked again, after a brief treatment. The
interest developed into a veritable “craze,”
and the glass factories were operated overtime
in order to meet the overwhelming
demand for blue glass, the price of which rapidly
advanced to fifty cents and even a dollar
for a small pane, because of the scarcity.
It was freely predicted that the days of
physicians were over, and that the blue glass
was the long-sought-for panacea for all human
ills. Suddenly, however, and from no
apparent cause, the interest in the matter
dropped, and now all that is left of the blue
glass craze is the occasional sight of an old
blue pane in some window, the owner of
which evidently felt disinclined to pay the
price of replacing it with a clear pane. Only
a few days ago, in an old-fashioned quarter
of a large city, the writer saw several panes
of the old blue glass in the frame of the
window of an old house which had seen better
days but which was now used as a cheap
tenement house.</p>

<p>The history of medicine is filled with records
of similar “crazes” following the announcement
of some new method of “cure.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>”
The striking peculiarity of these cures is
that they all occur during the height of the
excitement and notoriety of the early days
of the announcement, while <i>they decline in
proportion to the decline in public faith and
interest</i>, the explanation being that in every
instance the cure is effected by the action of
the mental states of expectancy, faith, and
the imagination of the patient, irrespective
of any virtue in the method or system itself.
In short, <i>all these cures belong to the category
of faith-cures</i>—they are merely duplicates
of the world-old cures resulting from
faith in sacred relics, shrines, bones of holy
people, sacred places, etc., of which nearly
every religion has given us many examples.
The history of medicine gives us many instances
of the efficacy of the therapeutic
power of Faith.</p>

<p>Sir Humphrey Davy relates a case in
which a man seriously ill manifested immediate
improvement after the placing of a
clinical thermometer in his mouth, he supposing
that it was some new and powerful
healing instrument. The grotesque remedies
of the ancient physicians, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
<i>bizarre</i> decoctions of the quacks of the present,
all work cures. The “bread-pills” and
other placebos of the “regulars” have cured
many a case when other remedies have
failed.</p>

<p>It is related that several hundred years
ago, a young English law-student while on a
lark with several of his boon companions
found themselves in a rural inn, without
money with which to pay their reckoning.
Finally, after much thought, the young man
called the inn-keeper and told him that he,
the student, was a great physician, and that
he would prepare for him a magic amulet
which would cure all diseases, in return for
the receipted account of himself and friends.
The landlord gladly consented, and the
young man wrote some gibberish on a bit of
parchment, which together with sundry articles
of rubbish he inserted in a silk cover.
With a wise and dignified air he then departed.
Many years rolled by, and the
young man rose to the position of a High
Justice of the realm. One day before him
was brought a woman accused of magic and
witchcraft. The evidence showed that she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
had cured many people by applying to their
bodies a little magic amulet, which the
church authorities considered to be the work
of the devil. The woman, on the stand, admitted
the use of the amulet and the many
cures resulting therefrom, but defended herself
by saying that the instrument of cure
had been given to her father, now deceased,
many years ago, by a great physician who
had stopped at her father’s inn. She held
that the cures were genuine medical cures
resulting from the medicinal virtues of the
amulet, and not the result of magic or witchcraft.
The Justice asked to be handed the
wonderful amulet. Ripping it open with his
pen-knife, he found enclosed the identical
scrawl inserted by himself many years before.
He announced the circumstances from
the bench, and discharged the woman—but
the healing virtues of the amulet had disappeared,
never to return. The cures were the
result of the faith and imagination of the
patients.</p>

<p>The modern instances of the several great
“Divine Healers,” such as John Alexander
Dowie of Chicago, and Francis Schlatter of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
Denver, give us additional evidence of the
efficacy of Faith as a therapeutic agent.
John Alexander Dowie, a Scotch preacher,
came to America some twenty years ago, and
instituted a new religion in which healing
was an important feature. He claimed that
all disease was the result of the devil, and
that belief in God and the prayers of Dowie
and his assistants would work the cure of
the devil’s evil operations. Great numbers
flocked to Dowie’s standard, and thousands
of wonderful cures were reported. His
“Tabernacle” was filled with testimonials
and trophies from cured people. Back of
Dowie’s pulpit were displayed many
crutches, plaster-casts, braces, and other
spoils wrested from the devil by Dowie and
his aids. His experience meetings were
thronged with persons willing and anxious
to testify that whereas they had been afflicted
they were now whole again. Dowie succeeded
in building up a great following all
over the world, and had he not overreached
himself and allowed his colossal vanity to
overshadow his original ideas, the probability
is that he would have founded a church<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
which would have endured for centuries. As
it is, he was discredited and disowned by
his followers, and his church is now but
little more than a memory.</p>

<p>Francis Schlatter, the German shoemaker
of Denver, with his Divine Healing, was a
well known figure in the west several years
ago. He was undoubtedly a half-insane fanatic,
believing himself inspired by God to
heal the nations. Persons flocked to him
from afar, and he is reported to have
healed thousands, many of whom were suffering
from serious ailments. He afterward
disappeared, and is believed to have
died in the desert of the far west. Students
of Mental Suggestion and Psychic Therapeutics
find in the instances of Dowie and
Schlatter merely the same underlying principle
of Mental Healing resulting from
faith, which is operative in all of the other
cases mentioned. The theology, creed, theories
of methods have but little to do with
the cures, so long as the proper degree of
faith is induced in the mind of the patient.
Faith in <i>anything</i> will work cures, providing
it is sufficiently intense and active.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span></p>

<p>Another branch of Mental Healing is seen
in the modern schools of the “New Thought,”
“Mental Science,” “Christian Science,”
and the “Emmanuel Movement.” The authorities
generally agree upon tracing the
rise of these several schools to the general
interest in the subject manifested in the
United States and Great Britain about the
middle of the last century. Some of the authorities
believe that this general interest
was induced largely by the teachings of
Charles Poyen, a Frenchman who came from
France to New England about 1835, bringing
with him the French teachings and theories
regarding mesmerism and the phenomena
allied thereto. Poyen’s teachings
attracted marked interest and attention, and
he soon had a host of followers, students and
imitators. Teachers of the “new science”
sprang up on all sides. Many theories were
evolved and actively supported by the adherents
of the several prominent teachers.
The rise of interest in phrenology and the
dawning interest in spiritualism aided the
spread of the new teachings regarding mesmerism,
clairvoyance, psychic healing, etc.,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
and the pages of many magazines and books
published about that time show that a public
taste had been created for the strange
and mysterious.</p>

<p>Dr. J. S. Grimes, a physician interested in
phrenology, taught that the phenomena were
due to the action of a strange atmospheric
force which he called “etherium.” Rev. J.
Bovee Dods evolved a theory based upon the
supposed existence of an electrical principle,
and called his system “Electro-Biology,” by
means of which he attracted to himself a
large following. Dods wrote several large
books on the subject, and traveled on lecture
tours in this country and Great Britain,
arousing great enthusiasm and making
many cures. Rev. Leroy Sunderland expounded
the doctrine of “patheism,” in
which he combined a strange mixture of
mysticism and what has since been called
“suggestion,” to which he afterward added
the current teachings of spiritualism after
his conversion to that philosophy. It would
seem that credit should be given Sunderland
for his early announcement of the principle
of suggestion, for he said: “When a rela<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>tion
is once established between an operator
and his patient, corresponding changes
may be induced in the nervous system of the
latter by mere volition, and <i>by suggestions
addressed to either of the external senses</i>.”
The decade, 1840-1850 witnessed a remarkable
interest in psychic phenomena of all
kinds, and during that time there was undoubtedly
laid the foundations upon which
the later structures have since been erected.
Any one reading the short stories of Poe,
and other writers of that period, may readily
see the state of public interest in these
subjects at that time.</p>

<p>The authorities generally agree that in
Phineas Parkhurst Quimby we have the direct
connecting link between the period just
mentioned and the present. Quimby played
quite an important role in the evolution of
the modern conceptions of mental healing,
or psycho-therapy as it is now called. He
was a poor clockmaker, of quite limited
means, of good character and a strong personality.
His education is said to have been
limited, but he made up for his lack in this
respect by his naturally keen and inquiring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
mind. In 1838 one of the teachers of mesmerism
visited his home in Belfast, Maine,
and Quimby attended the seance. He became
intensely interested in what he saw,
and in the theories propounded, and began
to experiment on the people in his town, the
result being that he soon acquired a reputation
as a powerful mesmerist and a good
healer. He followed along the general lines
of the “Electro-Biology” theory for a time,
and then evolved theories of his own. He
cured himself and many others by manual
treatment, and was soon kept quite busy in
his healing work.</p>

<p>Quimby, thinking deeply regarding the
cures he was making, soon came to the conclusion
that while his <i>cures</i> were genuine,
his <i>theories</i> were wrong. He gradually
evolved the idea that diseases are caused by
erroneous thinking, and that his cures resulted
from changing these wrong mental
states for those based upon true conceptions.
He held that all that is required to effect a
cure is to bring about “a change of thought.”
Following upon this new conception, he
ceased mesmerizing his patients, and began<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
to treat them by simply sitting by the side
of the afflicted person, picturing him as well
and whole, and impressing upon the patient’s
mind that he is well and whole, <i>in Truth</i>.
From this fundamental idea he gradually
evolved a philosophy which has strongly influenced
that of later schools. Quimby
talked much regarding his great “discovery,”
as he called it, and built great hopes
upon establishing “the science of health and
happiness.” He began to speak of the
“Truth” in his “science,” which he held to
be identical with that taught by Christ, and
by means of which Jesus performed his miraculous
cures. Before he had firmly established
his “science,” however, he died, leaving
his work to be carried on by others,
notably by Dr. Warren F. Evans, and Julius
A. Dresser, to whom should be given the
credit for launching what is now known as
“the New Thought Movement.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Mary Baker G. Eddy, who afterward
established “Christian Science” was one of
Quimby’s patients and students, and Dresser
and others have positively stated and
claimed that from him she received her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
ideas of the philosophy which she afterward
developed into the great “Christian Science”
movement. Mrs. Eddy, and her adherents,
as positively deny to Quimby any
credit for having inspired Mrs. Eddy’s
work. We merely state the opposing sides
of the controversy here, taking no sides in
the matter, the discussion not concerning us
in the present consideration.</p>

<p>The success of Evans and Dresser, and of
Mrs. Eddy, in their respective schools and
organizations, have caused many other
teachers to come to the front, until at the
present time there are many schools, cults
and organizations basing their cures upon
the broad principles of Mental Healing.
Mrs. Eddy, and her followers, deny having
anything in common with the other schools,
however, holding that the latter are concerned
with “mortal mind” while “Christian
Science” alone is based upon Divine
Mind, or Truth. In spite of the conflicting
claims and theories, the fact remains that
thousands of persons have been healed of
various diseases by the various schools,
cults, and teachings. To the authorities who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
stand outside of and apart from these opposing
organizations, it seems that all the
cures are based upon the same general principle,
<i>i. e.</i>, that of the influence of mental
states over physical conditions, and that religious
theories or metaphysical philosophies
have nothing whatever to do with the production
of the cures, except in the direction
of giving a strong suggestion to those accepting
them. The fact that <i>all</i> the schools
make cures, in about the same proportion,
and of the same general classes of complaints,
would seem to show that the theories
and dogmas have nothing to do with the
process of cure—and that the healing is done
<i>in spite of the theories</i>, rather than because
of them.</p>

<p>The much advertised “Emmanuel Movement”
now so popular in the orthodox
churches throughout the country, is recognized
by all the authorities as being nothing
more than suggestion applied in connection
with the religious and theological
principles of the churches in question, and, in
truth, as applying methods more in favor by
the old school of mesmerists than by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
later “New Thought” practitioners, or by
the “Christian Science” healers. From this
movement, however, there will probably
evolve a more scientific system, manifesting
none of the crudities which so disfigure its
present stage, at least in the hands of some
of its practitioners.</p>

<p>In the following chapter we may see that
the same element of Faith, Belief and Expectancy
is manifested in all the various
forms of Mental Healing, by whatever name,
or under whatever theory, the method is applied.
In short, that the cures are purely
<i>psychological</i>, rather than metaphysical or
religious, in their nature.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<p class="center">FAITH CURES</p>

<p>Following the scientific study of the phenomena
of cures of physical illness by means
of the power of mental states, and the recognition
of the fact that there is a common
principle operative under the various guises
and forms, there sprang into scientific usage
the term “Faith Cures” which was used to
designate all instances and forms of cures
coming under the general classification of
mental healing. Prof. Goddard defines the
term as follows: “A term applied to the
practice of curing disease by an appeal to
the hope, belief, or expectation of the patient,
and without the use of drugs or other
material means. Formerly it was confined
to methods requiring the exercise of religious
faith, such as the ‘prayer cure’ and ‘divine
healing,’ but has now come to be used in the
broader sense, and includes the cures of
‘Mental Science,’ and hypnotism; also a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
large part of the cures effected by patent
medicines and nostrums, as well as many
folk-practices and home remedies. By some
it is used to include also Christian Science,
but the believers in the latter regard it as
entirely distinct.”</p>

<p>The term “Suggestion,” used in the same
sense as “Faith Cure” in relation to the
healing of disease, has also come into popular
usage, but inasmuch as Suggestion has a
much larger meaning outside of its therapeutic
phases, it may be said the best authorities
to-day use the term “Faith Cure”
as representing simply one phase of Suggestion.</p>

<p>Prof. Goddard, in his article on “Faith
Cure,” in the <i>New International Encyclopaedia</i>
(Dodd, Mead &amp; Co., New York),
says: “Besides these recognized forms (divine
healing, mental science, etc.), faith cure
is an important element in cures wrought by
patent medicines and nostrums, home remedies
and folk practices. The advertisement,
testimonial of friend, or family tradition
arouses the faith of the sick man, and he
comes to believe that he needs only to fol<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>low
directions to be fully cured. The actual
value of faith cure as a therapeutic method
has been the subject of much discussion. It
can no longer be denied that it has value.
From divine healing to patent medicine and
Father Kneipp’s water cure, all cure disease.
Each appeals to a particular type of
mind, but <i>the results are practically the same
in all—same diseases cured, same successes,
same failures</i>. Many faith-curists claim that
all diseases in all persons can be cured by
their method; others hold that the principle
is of limited application. Of them all, the
hypnotists are the only ones who do not
make sweeping claims.”</p>

<p>After stating “the tendency to exaggeration
and the infrequency of impartial judgment”
in connection with many instances of
claimed cures, the above mentioned authority
proceeds as follows: “The actual cures,
however, are sufficiently numerous and sufficiently
striking to need an explanation.
These different forms agree in only one
point—viz., <i>the mental state of the patient
is one of hope and expectation</i>. Can states
of mind cause or cure disease? Some fa<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>miliar
occurrences seem to justify an affirmative
answer. It is well known that certain
glands and secretions are markedly affected
by emotions. Fright causes the saliva to
cease to flow and the perspiration to start.
Sorrow causes the lachrymal glands to secrete
tears. Happiness favors digestion,
unhappiness retards it. Mosso has demonstrated
that the bladder is especially sensitive
to emotional states. In general, the
pleasant emotions produce an opposite physical
effect from the unpleasant ones. There
are many glands within the body whose action
under emotion we cannot observe; but
we may reasonably assume that they also
are affected by emotional states. Hence, if
unpleasant emotions so act upon the glands
as to derange the system and cause disease,
the pleasant emotions may reasonably be assumed
to tend to restore the normal functions.
The various forms of faith cure tend
strongly to put the patient in a happy frame
of mind—a condition favorable to health.
However, there are all degrees of faith and
wide differences in the way the system responds
to the emotional state. One person<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
is slightly affected by a strong emotion; another
is strongly affected by a weak emotion.
Hence, there must always be a wide
difference in the results of faith-cure methods.
The diseases most amenable to faith
cure are nervous—including many not recognized
as nervous, but having a neural
condition as their basis—and functional derangements.
Organic diseases are not usually
cured, though the symptoms are frequently
ameliorated. Chronic diseases due
to neuro-muscular habit often yield to hypnotic
treatment.”</p>

<p>Prof. R. P. Halleck says: “Were it not
for this power of the imagination, the majority
of quack nostrums would disappear.
In most cases bread pills, properly labeled,
with positive assurances of certain cures accompanying
them, would answer the purpose
far better than these nostrums, or even much
better than a great deal of the medicine administered
by regular physicians. Warts
have been charmed away by medicines which
could have had only a mental effect. Dr.
Tuke gives many cases of patients cured of
rheumatism by rubbing them with a certain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
substance declared to possess magic power.
The material in some cases was metal; in
others wood; in still others, wax. He also
recites the case of a very intelligent officer
who had vainly taken powerful remedies to
cure cramp in the stomach. Then ‘he was
told that on the next attack he would be put
under a medicine which was generally believed
to be most effective, but which was
rarely used.’ When the cramps came on
again, ‘a powder containing four grains of
ground biscuit was administered every seven
minutes, while the greatest anxiety was expressed
(within the hearing of the party)
lest too much be given. Half-drachm doses
of bismuth had never procured the same relief
in less than three hours. For four successive
times did the same kind of attack recur, and
four times was it met by the same remedy,
and with like success.’ A house surgeon in
a French hospital experimented with one
hundred patients, giving them sugared
water. Then, with a great show of fear, he
pretended that he had made a mistake and
given them an emetic instead of the proper
medicine. Dr. Tuke says: ‘The result may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
easily be anticipated by those who can estimate
the influence of the imagination. No
fewer than eighty—four-fifths—were unmistakably
sick.’</p>

<p>“We have a well authenticated case of a
butcher, who, while trying to hang up a
heavy piece of meat, slipped and was himself
caught by the arm upon the hook. When he
was taken to a surgeon, the butcher said he
was suffering so much that he could not endure
the removal of his coat; the sleeve must
be cut off. When this was done, it was
found that the hook had passed through his
clothing close to the skin, but had not even
scratched it. A man sentenced to be bled
to death was blindfolded. A harmless incision
was then made in his arm and tepid
water fixed so as to run down it and drop
with considerable noise into a basin. The
attendants frequently commented on the
flow of blood and the weakening pulse. The
criminal’s false idea of what was taking
place was as powerful in its effects as the
reality, and he soon died.... There is
perhaps not a person living who would not
at times be benefited by a bread pill, admin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>istered
by some one in whom great confidence
was reposed.”</p>

<p>The same authority also says: “It has been
known for a long time that if the attention
is directed toward any bodily organ, abnormal
sensations may be caused in it, and disease
may be developed. The renowned Dr.
John Hunter said: ‘I am confident that I can
fix my attention to any part, until I have
a sensation in that part.’” Dr. Tuke says
that these “are words which ought to be inscribed
in letters of gold over the entrance
of a hospital for the Cure of Disease by Psychopathy.”
Hunter’s confident assertion is
the more interesting because, drawn from
his own experience, it shows that the principle
is not confined in its operation to the
susceptible and nervous, but operates even
on men of the highest mental endowment.
We have examples from the literature of the
seventeenth century, showing how the expectation
of a complaint will produce it. In
1607 an ignorant English physician told a
clergyman’s wife that she had sciatica, although
there was, in reality, nothing the
matter with her sciatic nerve. Her attention<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
was thereby directed to it and a severe attack
of sciatica was the result. When a
person inexperienced in medicine reads carefully
the symptoms of some disease, he is
apt to begin an attentive search for those
symptoms and to end by fancying he has
them. Seasick persons have been relieved of
their nausea by being made to bail a leaking
boat from the fear that it would sink.
All their attention was thereby diverted
from themselves. Many can recall how children,
and grown persons, too, have forgotten
all about their alleged intense thirst, as
soon as their attention was diverted. Some
persons, after eating something which they
fancy is a trifle indigestible, center their attention
upon the stomach, expecting symptoms
of indigestion, and are often not disappointed.
A man who had good reason to
fear hydrophobia, determined that he would
not have it. The pain in the bitten arm became
intense, and he saw that he must have
something to divert his attention from the
wound and his danger. He therefore went
hunting, but found no game. To make
amends, he summoned a more inflexible will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
and exerted at every step ‘a strong mental
effort against the disease.’ He kept on
hunting until he felt better, and he mastered
himself so perfectly that he probably thereby
warded off an attack of hydrophobia. Accordingly
as we center our attention upon
one thing or another, we largely determine
our mental happiness and hence our bodily
health. One person, in walking through a
noble forest, may search only for spiders,
and venomous creatures, while another confines
his attention to the singing birds in the
branches above. One reason why travel is
such a cure for diseases of body and mind
is because so many new things thereby come
in to claim the attention and divert it from
its former objects. The following expression
from Dr. Tuke should be remembered:
‘<i>Thought strongly directed to any part tends
to increase its vascularity, and consequently
its sensibility</i>.’”</p>

<p>Dr. C. F. Winbigler says: “The practitioner
secures the same effects from a placebo
or powdered pop-corn as from some drugs
by using suggestion with the former. Every
successful physician has used this method<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
at one time or another, and sometimes when
he was utterly puzzled as to what he should
prescribe, he thus secured a marvellous result,
and a cure of the patient was effected....
Every believer in Psycho-therapeutics
knows that there is a psychical as well
as a physical effect from the use of drugs.
The psychical value is based on the expectation
of their special action, and that which
is in the physician’s mind may be subtly and
powerfully carried over into the patient’s
mind. The physician’s personality, attitude
and interest in the patient accomplishes
vastly more than the drugs he prescribes or
administers. If he is cheerful and hopeful,
he gives potency to their action; if he is
gloomy, pessimistic and hopeless, he nullifies
their effects. The cure of the patient is
effected through the subconscious mind, and
the attitude and bearings of the physician,
attendants, the surroundings and the medicines
employed, become powerful suggestions.”</p>

<p>Prof. Elmer Gates says: “The system
makes an effort to eliminate the metabolic
products of tissue-waste, and it is therefore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
not surprising that during acute grief tears
are copiously excreted; that during sudden
fear the bowels and the kidneys are caused
to act, that during prolonged fear, the body
is covered with a cold perspiration; and, that
during anger, the mouth tastes bitter, due
largely to the increased elimination of sulpho-cyanates.
The perspiration during fear
is chemically different, and even smells different
from that which exudes during a happy
mood.... Now if it can be shown
in many ways that the elimination of waste
products is retarded by sad and painful emotions;
nay, worse than that, these depressing
emotions directly augment the amount of
these poisons. Conversely, the pleasurable
and happy emotions, during the time they
are active, inhibit the poisonous effects of
the depressing moods, and cause the bodily
cells to create and store up vital energy and
nutritive tissue products.”</p>

<p>In an issue of “<i>The American Practitioner
and News</i>,” is reported a discussion before
the Lexington (Ky.) Medical and Surgical
Society, in which a member, Dr. Guest, related
the following experience: “I have a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
brother-in-law who suffers every summer
with hay-fever. He has a relative who believes
in Christian Science. She told him
that she felt positive that she could direct
him to a woman, a Christian Scientist, who
would cure him. He at first objected, because
he hated to go to a woman physician.
He arranged, however, to communicate with
her daily by letter. When his hay-fever
broke out he suffered with it all that day
and night, and the next morning wrote her
a note telling her to put him on treatment
immediately. When he returned that night
he was improved and slept better. He wrote
a second note the next morning and was
much encouraged. The third day he repeated
his letter writing and stated that the
symptoms had almost ceased. And he was
guying me about being cured by Christian
Science when regular physicians could do
nothing for him. The night of the third day,
when he came home to supper, he found a
note from the Christian Scientist, stating
that <i>she has been in the country and would
put him under treatment the next day</i>.
Realizing that all his treatment had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
only in his imagination, the symptoms reappeared
with the same intensity as before.”</p>

<p>Dr. A. J. Parks of New York, says: “The
absolute and complete control that the sympathetic
nervous system exercises over the
physical organization is so perfectly clear
and well-known to every observer that the
recital of the phenomena in the vast and
countless series of manifestations is unnecessary.
We are all aware of the fact that
digestion is promptly arrested upon the receipt
of bad news. The appetite at once disappears.
It ceases, and the whole system
feels the effect of the depressing impulse—the
mental and spiritual wave which lowers
the vital thermometer. Fear not only suspends
the digestive function but arrests the
formation of the secretions upon which digestion
depends. A sudden fright frequently
paralyzes the heart beyond recovery,
whereas a pleasant and pleasing message
soothes and gently excites the whole granular
system, increases the secretions, aids digestion
and sends a thrill of joy to the
sensorium, which diffuses the glad tidings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
to every nerve fibril in the complex organization.”</p>

<p>Dr. T. A. Borton, in an address before the
Indiana State Medical Society, said: “The
subject which I desire to present to you to-day
has to do with the influence of the mind
over the functions of the body. Its silent,
unobserved force results in producing pathological
conditions, and those, by reflex action,
excite morbid sensibilities of the mind
and thus derange the nerve centres, resulting
in a changed condition or over-excitability
of the nerve energies, which becomes a
secondary diseased condition in the form of
different types of neurasthenia. I have been
interested in this subject for many years,
and in my practice have had extended opportunities
for making observations as to
the potency of the mental and suggestive
pathology bearing on this subject. I would
especially refer to the healing of the body
through these mental forces, changing
healthy, normal conditions into unhealthy or
diseased conditions and <i>vice versa</i>. These
changes are not miraculous, but proceed
from natural causes in the operation of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
mind, as a therapeutic agency, operating
through the functions of the body, sometimes
as a tonic or stimulant, warding off diseases
under the most exposed conditions, defending
and holding the system in a state of
health, while those void of these mental assurances
become victims to the ravages of
disease through contagion or infection. This
protective mental force of the mind has been
demonstrated many times in hospitals and
other places where contagious diseases were
prevailing. The mental force possesses a
protective power when rightly exercised beyond
what is usually conceded, not only in
the way of defense; but also in correcting
disease when in existence. I believe these
to be much greater than has been generally
admitted or understood.... We all
know how difficult it is to get good results
from medication in which our patients have
no confidence, and it is an established fact
that we get better results from drugs which
are given with the patient’s knowledge of
their intended effect. <i>I have often produced
desired results from means entirely inert,
stating the desired and expected effect of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
its administration. I have frequently quieted
the severest pain by injecting pure water
into the arm of the patient.</i>”</p>

<p>Dr. G. R. Patton, in an address before the
Wabasha County (Minn.) Medical Society,
said: “As Bacon said, ‘Faith, confidence, belief
and hope are the working forces that
make the cure—that work the miracle.’ The
mind as a dynamic force exerted over the
functions of the body has been, doubtless,
operatively manifest from the cradle of our
existence. By the phrase, ‘the mind as a
dynamic force,’ I refer to the various forms
of suggestion as well as to various affective
faculties of the mind, or those states caused
by the sympathetic action of the brain, such
as faith, confidence, belief, imagination, emotions,
hope and the like. Any or all of them
may become active over the bodily functions....
As instance of the mental impression
acting upon observable functions revealed
through the capillary circulation as
revealed to the sight, I will mention blushing
or pallor of the face, depending upon the
theme presented to the thought; the mouth
watering on the sight or thought of tempt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>ing
food; the flow of tears from words or
thoughts that excite grief; nausea or vomiting
from a sickening spectacle; sexual excitement
from obscene thought or lascivious
sights. Instances might be multiplied. And
is it not a fair inference, indeed, that through
the vasomoter nerves, the internal viscera
may be subject to like effects through mental
impressions, and that thus acute as well
as chronic congestive ailments thereof may
be favorably influenced or even cured thereby?...
It is my conviction that recognition
of the power and usefulness of mental
dynamics, including all forms of suggestion
over physiological and pathological
processes in combating diseases, is unquestionably
the most impressive advance in
modern medicine. Mental influence alone
may diminish or increase the activities of
the physiological processes to the extent of
removing the pathological effects of disease....
A celebrated medical teacher, after
an exhaustive dissertation over a case was
leaving the bedside without prescribing any
treatment when the house physician asked
what should be given the patient. ‘Oh,’ said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
the professor, ‘a hopeful prognosis and
anything else you please.’ To this he added,
‘the doleful doctor will be a failure, while
the hopeful one will prove a winner from
start to finish.’ It is reasonably assured
that ultimately the physician will become not
so much the man behind the pill as the judicious
advisor, the wise counsellor, gently leading
the sick ‘into green pastures, beside still
waters,’ through paths that lead onward to
recovery, assisting nature at times, if needs
be, with a big bread pill.”</p>

<p>Dr. Herbert A. Parkyn, the well-known authority
on suggestive therapeutics, says:
“Certain results will follow certain thoughts,
and in every instance that it is possible to
get the patient to think the thoughts we desire,
we secure the results we desire. It is
the work of the suggestionist to place these
thoughts in the mind of the patient so that
he is bound to think them, and this can be
done to some degree, if not perfectly, in
every case. It is well to have faith, but faith
is not absolutely necessary at the outset. It
is time enough for the patient to have faith
in the treatment when he can perceive the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
benefit he is receiving. Understanding the
mental and physical changes which follow a
certain thought, the suggestionist is able to
bring about those mental or physical changes,
by using direct suggestion in such a way
that his patient is bound to think the
thoughts which will produce the results. A
man may not have faith in the statement that
the thought of lemon juice will stimulate the
flow of saliva, but if he will imagine for a
moment that he is squeezing the juice of a
lemon into his mouth the saliva will immediately
flow more freely than usual, regardless
of his faith. Similarly, many, if not all
of the organs of the body, can be affected by
impulses following certain lines of thought,
and these impulses will follow the thought
and stimulate the organs regardless of faith.
It is simply necessary to get a patient to
think the proper thoughts, and it is in the
thought directing that the work of the suggestionist
lies.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<p class="center">THE POWER OF THE IMAGINATION</p>

<p>Dr. F. W. Southworth says: “Fear is itself
a contagious disease and is sometimes
reflected from one mind to another with great
rapidity. It passes from one to another,
from the healthy to the ill, from doctor or
nurse to patient, from mother to child, and
so on. The greatest fears we can usually
get away from, but it is the little fears and
anxieties, constant apprehension, fears of
imagined evils of all sorts which prey upon
our vitality and lessen our powers, thus rendering
us more susceptible to disease. To
avert disease, then, we must eradicate fear;
but how shall we accomplish it? Through
wise education—educating the people to a
higher standard of living; by teaching a
sounder hygiene; a wiser philosophy and a
more cheerful theology. By erasing a thousand
errors and superstitions from fearful
minds and pointing them to the light,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
beauty and loveliness of the truth. This
mental and moral sanitation is still ahead of
us, but it is more valuable and desirable than
all quarantines, inventions, experiments, and
microscopical researches after physical or
material causes.”</p>

<p>Sir George Paget, M. D., says: “In many
cases I have seen reasons for believing that
cancer has had its origin in prolonged anxiety.”
Dr. Murchison says: “I have been
surprised to find how often patients with
primary cancer of the liver have traced the
cause of this illness to protracted grief and
anxiety. These cases have been far too numerous
to be accounted for as merely coincidents.”
Sir B. W. Richardson, M. D., says:
“Eruptions of the skin frequently follow excessive
mental strain. In all these, as well
as in cancer, epilepsy and mania, the cause
is frequently partly or wholly mental. It is
remarkable how little the question of the
origin of physical disease from mental influences
has been studied.” Prof. Elmer
Gates says: “My experiments show that
irascible, malevolent and depressing emotions
generate in the system injurious com<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>pounds,
some of which are extremely poisonous.
Also that agreeable, happy emotions
generate chemical compounds of nutritious
value which stimulate the cells to manufacture
energy.”</p>

<p>Dr. Patton, in the address before the Wabasha
County Medical Society, above mentioned,
gives the following interesting case
of the effect of faith and expectant attention,
or Suggestion: He said: “While surgeon
of a Cincinnati hospital one of the messenger
boys was often disobedient of orders.
The sister superior once asked me how to
punish him. I suggested putting him to bed
and making him sick with medicine. My advice
was acted upon with alacrity. A tea-spoonful
of <i>colored water</i> was given him
every fifteen minutes. With assumed gravity,
I ordered the nurse, in the boy’s presence,
to keep giving the medicine until he became
sick and vomited. Within an hour he
vomited profusely.... A funny incident
illustrative of the faith and confidence
sometimes reposed in the medical man and
his power in curing disease, happened in
my first year of practice. An Irish laborer,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
much given to profanity, came to my office,
with a cold on his chest. I prescribed a
soothing mixture and a liniment of camphor,
ammonia and soap. A few days later,
meeting him on the street, I asked him if the
medicine had cured him all right. He replied
with enthusiasm, ‘Oh! yes, yes, it acted
most beautifully and cured me pretty d—— d
quick, but it was awful hot stuff, for it
burned in my throat like hell-fire itself.’ I
knew at once, but did not tell him, that he
had been swallowing the liniment of camphor,
hartshorn and soap, and rubbing the
cough mixture on the outside. His faith was
even stronger than the liniment, and cured
him in spite of the blunder.</p>

<p>“Perhaps the most wonderful confirmation
came under my observation while wintering
in San Antonio, Texas, in 1880. Some
nostrum fakirs with a retinue of fourteen
musicians and comedians came to this city
in an immense chariot, drawn by eight gaily
caparisoned horses. Every evening they
came upon the military plaza to sell their
panacea. I went over one evening out of
curiosity, being attracted by the songs and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
music. The head fakir was shouting to an
immense crowd about the virtues of his specific.
He claimed that it contained thirteen ingredients,
gathered at a great expense from
all quarters of the globe, and would cure all
the ills that flesh was heir to. Cures were
warranted in every case, or the money refunded
on the following evening. After this
harangue, he said that the medicine was for
sale at $1 per bottle, until 300 bottles had
been sold, as it was an invariable rule to sell
only that number on any one evening. Immediately
a frenzied mob rushed pell-mell
to the end of the chariot, each one holding
aloft a silver dollar. He had previously announced
that no change would be made, and
that every one to get the medicine should
have a dollar ready in his hand. In half an
hour 300 bottles had been sold, the empty
trunk closed with a bang, and the statement
made that no more could be had until the
following evening, although there was yet a
great multitude clamoring for more. Curiosity
again led me to the plaza the next
evening, and I went early. The initial performance
was a free tooth-pulling, to last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
thirty minutes. He said he was the kingpin
of the tooth-pullers, and I believe he
was. The rapidity of his work was a marvel.
He snatched from various jaws about 250
teeth, including the good ones, within the
limit, throwing them from his forceps right
and left among his audience. Those operated
upon were wrought to such a frenzy
of excitement and wonder that each one,
without an exception, declared that no pain
whatever had been experienced. A call was
then made for the 300 who had bought medicine
on the previous evening to mount the
chariot and tell what the medicine had done
for them.</p>

<p>“From every quarter men and women,
both white and colored, pressed forward to
give their experience. Their stories were
grotesque and curious enough, but no matter
what their ailments, cures had resulted in
every case. At the end of half an hour,
while the experience meeting was at its acme,
the fakir abruptly closed it, saying, in a regretful
voice, that the rest would have to
wait until the next evening to tell of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
cures, as he now wanted those to come forward
who had not been cured by the medicine
bought on the previous evening. He
stood in silence with folded arms for three
minutes. No one having come forward, the
voice of this arrant charlatan rang out in
stentorian tones, ‘All, <i>all</i> have been cured!
We have cured <i>everyone</i>!’ Then another
300 bottles were sold in a jiffy, I myself
being one of the fortunate purchasers. The
chief of this outfit stopped in the hotel where
I was. After dinner the next day, I made
his acquaintance in the smoking room, saying
I was a doctor, too; that I had attended
two of his soirees, bought his medicine and
was greatly interested in it. I surprised him
by the statement that his medicine was made
by M. &amp; Co., wholesale druggists of Cincinnati,
and that it was fluid extract of podophyllin.
He stared for some moments, but
made no reply. I continued, ‘I know M.’s
fluid extract, as his process of its manufacture
is peculiar, and differs from other manufacturers
in this, that he exhausts the root
by percolation with alcohol, ether and glycerine,
giving the product a sweetish taste<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
and a slight ethereal odor.’ The man asked
if I was also a chemist. I replied, ‘Yes, I
once lectured in a medical college in Cincinnati
on drugs and their uses, and I can
readily tell fluid extracts by their taste, odor
and physical characteristics.’</p>

<p>“After some hesitation, he said, ‘Yes, this
is M.’s podophyllin <i>and nothing else</i>.’ I inquired
if he attributed all his success to the
medicine. He answered, ‘No, for once in
Missouri the mandrake ran out before a new
lot arrived. We found something like it in a
drug store of the town, and the people got
well just the same. <i>If the people believe
you can cure them, and have faith in your
medicine, they get well anyway, or they
think they do, which is the same thing.</i>’
The fakirs remained one week, sold 2,100 bottles,
and presumably cured 2,100 people, as
no one came forward to reclaim his dollar
for the medicine, which was contained in a
two-drachm vial of 120 drops. A dose was
one drop after each meal in one spoonful of
water.</p>

<p>“When I was in California recently a
friend mentioned that an intelligent relative<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
of his was being treated by a celebrated
Chinese doctor. The relative claimed that
Chinese physicians were better than our
own; that they had devoted 5,000 years to
medicine and had thus become so learned and
skillful that they could tell all diseases without
asking a single question, simply by feeling
the pulse. Out of curiosity I visited this
physician, ostensibly as a patient. Without
so declaring myself, he knew intuitively that
I came to consult him. Without asking any
questions he placed his finger upon my right
wrist, communed with himself for a few
moments, and then gravely informed me that
I had <i>thirty-seven diseases</i>; some in the
blood, some in the brain, some in the kidneys,
some in the liver, and many others in the
heart and lungs. He said it would take <i>sixteen
different herbs</i> to cure me. He volunteered
the statement that he could detect
6,000 diseases by the pulse alone, and that
he used 400 herbs in the treatment of the
various diseases. Upon his request, I examined
his portfolio containing 350 testimonials
of marvellous cures, wrought upon
American residents of California during his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
seventeen years’ practice on the coast. Many
of them were from parties of intelligence
and eminence, and were so extraordinary
that nothing short of their being attested by
numerous witnesses of unimpeachable veracity,
could satisfy one of their truth. Now,
permit me to say that I have no pulse in the
right wrist, the pulse being congenitally absent;
but through it he made the pretense of
locating so many diseases. This doubtless is
the form and character of medical practice
in China among the native Chinamen, and
probably has been for many centuries among
a population of 400,000,000. Is not the logic
from the above facts irresistible, that in
China the native physician cannot tell one
disease from another, and that all his work
is simply nonsense and guess work? There
can be no escape from this conclusion—it
follows as lucidly as a demonstrated problem
in Euclid—<i>that</i> any benefit that may
ever accrue from their treatment is wholly
due to the dynamic force of the brain upon
the functions of the body.”</p>

<p>The following, from a Philadelphia journal,
gives a striking illustration of the fact<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
that the imagination is a <i>real</i> factor in many
cases of physical ailment: “The fact that
the throes of the imagination under great
nervous excitement often produce a corresponding
physical frenzy was illustrated recently
in the case of a man who had gone to
sleep with his artificial teeth in his mouth.
Waking suddenly with a choking sensation,
he found his teeth had disappeared. He
looked in the glass of water where they were
usually deposited, did not see them and realized
they must be far down his throat. Choking
and struggling, he hammered on the door
of a friend sleeping in the house, who, seeing
his critical condition, vainly tried to
draw the teeth out of the sufferer’s throat.
He could feel the teeth, but had not the
strength to extract them. He ran for a
blacksmith who lived a few doors away, but
the blacksmith’s hand was too big to put into
the man’s mouth. A doctor had been sent
for, but he was so long in coming that the
victim of the accident seemed likely to die
of suffocation before the physician arrived.
A little girl of ten years was brought under
the impression that her small hand might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
reach the obstacle and withdraw it, but she
got frightened and began to cry. The sufferer
became black in the face, his throat
swelled out, and his friends expected every
moment to be his last, when finally the doctor
arrived. He heard the history of the
case, saw that the teeth were not in the man’s
jaws nor in their nightly receptacle, felt the
throat and cast his eyes seriously upon the
floor. <i>There, on the floor, he saw the
whole set of teeth.</i> He adjusted them to
the jaws of the patient, told him to breathe
freely, and every symptom of suffocation
disappeared.”</p>

<p>The following from an Eastern journal illustrates
another phase of the subject: “Saltpetriere,
the hospital for nervous diseases,
made famous by the investigations of Dr.
Charcot, has an interesting case of religious
mania. The patient, who is a woman of
about forty years of age, entertains the belief
that she is crucified, and this delusion
has caused a contraction of the muscles of
the feet of such a nature that she can walk
only on tip-toe. The patient, moreover, is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
subject occasionally to the still more extraordinary
manifestation—that of ‘stigmata.’
Instances of ‘stigmata’ are tolerably frequent
in the ‘Lives of the Saints’ of alleged
supernatural marks on the body in imitation
of the wounds of Christ. These ‘stigmata’
have been observed beyond all question on
the woman at the Saltpetriere. Their appearance
on the body coincides with the return
of the most solemn religious anniversaries.
These ‘stigmata’ are so visible that
it has been possible to photograph them. The
doctors of the Saltpetriere in order to assure
themselves that these manifestations were
not the result of trickery, contrived a sort
of shade having a glass front and metal
sides, and capable of being hermetically attached
to the body by means of India rubber
fixings. These shades were placed in
position a considerable time before the dates
at which the stigmata are wont to appear.
When they were affixed there were no marks
whatever on the patient’s body, but at the
expected period the ‘stigmata’ were visible
as usual through the glass.”</p>

<p>In a Southern journal there is reported an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
interesting case, in which a New Orleans
physician tells the following story: “A nervous
man recently called on me and asked,
‘In what part of the abdomen are the premonitory
pains of appendicitis felt?’ On
the <i>left</i> side, exactly here,’ I replied, indicating
a spot a little above the point of the
hip-bone. He went out, and next afternoon
I was summoned in hot haste to the St.
Charles hotel. I found the planter writhing
on his bed, his forehead beaded with sweat,
and his whole appearance indicating intense
suffering. ‘I have an attack of appendicitis,’
he groaned, ‘and I’m a dead man! I’ll never
survive an operation!’ ‘Where do you feel
the pain?’ I asked. ‘Oh, right here,’ he replied,
putting his finger on the spot I had
located at the office. ‘I feel as if somebody
had a knife in me turning it around.’ ‘Well,
then, it isn’t appendicitis, at any rate,’ I
said cheerfully, ‘because <i>it is the wrong side</i>.’
‘The wrong side!’ he exclaimed, glaring at
me indignantly. ‘Why, you told me yourself
it was on the <i>left</i> side!’ ‘Then I must
have been abstracted,’ I replied calmly; ‘I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
should have said the <i>right</i> side.’ I prescribed
something that wouldn’t hurt him,
and learned afterward that he ate his dinner
in the dining-room the same evening. Oh!
yes; he was no doubt in real pain when I
called, <i>but you can make your finger ache
merely by concentrating your attention on it
for a few moments</i>.”</p>

<p>Frank F. Moore, in “A Journalist’s Note
Book” tells the following amusing and significant
story of the influence of imagination
upon health. “A young civil servant in India,
feeling fagged from the excessive heat
and from long hours of work consulted the
best doctor within reach. The doctor looked
him over, sounded his heart and lungs, and
then said gravely: ‘I will write you tomorrow.’
The next day the young man received a
letter telling him that his left lung was gone
and his heart seriously affected, and advising
him to lose no time in adjusting his business
affairs. ‘Of course, you may live for
weeks,’ the latter said, ‘but you had best
not leave important matters undecided.’
Naturally the young official was dismayed
by so dark a prognosis—nothing less than a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
death warrant. Within twenty-four hours
he was having difficulty with his respiration,
and was seized with an acute pain in the
region of the heart. He took to his bed with
the feeling that he should never rise from
it. During the night he became so much
worse that his servant sent for the doctor.
‘What on earth have you been doing to yourself?’
demanded the doctor. ‘There were no
indications of this sort when I saw you yesterday?’
‘It is my heart, I suppose,’ weakly
answered the patient. ‘Your heart!’ repeated
the doctor. ‘Your heart was all right
yesterday.’ ‘My lungs, then.’ ‘What is the
matter with you, man? You don’t seem to
have been drinking?’ ‘Your letter,’ gasped
the patient. ‘You said I had only a few
weeks to live.’ ‘Are you crazy?’ said the
doctor. ‘I wrote you to take a few weeks
vacation in the hills, and you would be all
right.’ For reply the patient drew the letter
from under the bedclothes and gave it to
the doctor. ‘Heavens!’ cried that gentleman
as he glanced at it. ‘This was meant for another
man! My assistant has mixed up the
letters.’ The young man at once sat up in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
bed and made a rapid recovery. And what
of the patient for whom the direful prognosis
was intended? Delighted with the report
that a sojourn in the hills would set
him right, he started at once, and five years
later was alive and in fair health.”</p>

<p>The following is clipped from a medical
journal: “Some physician makes use of this
suggestive phrase—‘the dynamic power of an
idea,’ and, as an illustration of what is meant
by this expression, the following incident is
related. Not long ago a man in taking medicine
was suddenly possessed by the notion
that he had by mistake taken arsenic. His
wife insisted to the contrary, but he proceeded
to manifest all the peculiar symptoms
of arsenical poisoning, and finally died.
So certain was his wife that he had not taken
arsenic that an autopsy was held, when not
an atom of the poison could be found. Of
what did this man die? Arsenic? No, of
the dynamic power of an idea or arsenic.
Happily for humanity this dynamic power of
ideas works constructively no less certainly
than it does destructively, and an idea of
health fixed in the consciousness and persis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>tently
adhered to would tend to bring the
best results. Over a hundred years ago, old
John Hunter said, ‘<i>As the state of mind
is capable of producing disease, another
state of it may effect a cure</i>.’”</p>

<p>Dr. William C. Prime relates the following
case in his book “Among the Northern
Hills.” “The judge was summoned in a
hurry to see an old lady who had managed
her farm for forty years since her husband’s
death. She had two sons, and a stepson,
John, who was not an admirable person.
After a long drive on a stormy night the
judge found the old lady apparently just
alive, and was told by the doctor in attendance
to hurry, as his patient was very weak.
The judge brought paper and ink with him.
He found a stand and a candle, placed them
at the head of the bed, and after saying a
few words to the woman, told her he was
ready to prepare the will if she would go on
and tell him what she wanted him to do. He
wrote the introductory phrase rapidly, and
leaning over toward her said, ‘Now, go on,
Mrs. Norton.’</p>

<p>“Her voice was quite faint, and she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
seemed to speak with an effort. She said:
‘First of all, I want to give the farm to my
sons, Harry and James. Just put that
down.’ ‘But,’ said the judge, ‘you can’t do
that, Mrs. Norton. The farm isn’t yours to
give away.’ ‘The farm isn’t mine?’ she said
in a voice decidedly stronger than before.
‘No, the farm isn’t yours. You have only a
life interest in it.’ ‘This farm that I’ve
run for goin’ on forty-three year next spring
isn’t mine to do with what I please with it?
Why not, Judge I’d like to know what you
mean!’ ‘Why, Mr. Norton, your husband,
gave you a life estate in all his
property, and on your death the farm
goes to his son, John, and <i>your</i> children
get the village houses. I have explained
that to you very often before.’ ‘And
when I die, John Norton is to have this
house and farm whether I will or not?’ ‘Just
so. It will be his.’ ‘<i>Then I ain’t goin’ to
die!</i>’ said the old woman, in a clear and decidedly
ringing and healthy voice. And so
saying, she threw her feet over the front of
the bed, sat up, gathered a blanket and coverlet
about her, straightened her gaunt form,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
walked across the room and sat down in a
great chair before the fire.</p>

<p>“The doctor and the judge went home.
That was fifteen years ago. <i>The old lady is
alive to-day.</i> And she accomplished her intent,
She beat John after all. He died four
years ago.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<p class="center">BELIEF AND SUGGESTION</p>

<p>The writer has been informed by a prominent
physician of Chicago, that for many
years he has been in the habit of administering
hypodermic injections of distilled water,
accompanying the same by the statement
that he is injecting morphine. He states
that in every case, he has succeeded in inducing
a quiet, peaceful sleep, and a cessation
of pain after the injection, which can
be attributed only to the <i>belief</i> of the patient.
The same physician also relates the case of
a woman who believed that she had taken
strychnine by mistake. When the doctor
was called he found the woman manifesting
every symptom of strychnine poisoning,
even down to the most minute details, and
he is of the opinion that death would have
ensued in a short time had he not proceeded
to administer the regular antidotes and restorative
treatment. After the woman was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
brought out of the condition, it was discovered
that the supposed strychnine was
nothing but a harmless powder. In relating
the case, the physician always adds that the
woman had witnessed the death struggles of
a dog which had been poisoned by strychnine
several months previous, which might
have had some effect in enabling her to unconsciously
counterfeit the symptoms.</p>

<p>Dr. Max Eastman, in a recent magazine
article says: “The mission of this paper is
to offer guidance in a matter about which a
great quantity of the general public is very
much at sea. In this question of ‘mind over
matter,’ the reformers have done their work.
They have stirred things up. They have bestowed
upon the world about a hundred and
fifty little religions and a confused idea that
there must be some truth in the matter somewhere.
The ignorant have done their work.
They have persecuted the believers, jeered at
them, or damned them with a vacuous smile.
The world will never lack ballast. It is only
the scientists that have failed of their duty.
They have stalked through a routine of elevated
lectures, written a few incomprehen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>sible
books, and kept the science of psychology,
so far as the hungry world goes, sealed
up in their own proud bosoms. In all this
uproar of faith-cures, and miracles, and
shouting prophets, we have heard few illuminating
words from the universities.
The consequence is that we are without a
helm, and the reform blows now one way and
now another....</p>

<p>“The law of suggestion, which is one of
the great discoveries of modern science, was
first formulated by Dr. Liebault at Paris, in
a book published in 1866. Since his day the
number of physicians who practice ‘suggestive
therapeutics’ has steadily increased,
until to-day no thorough clinical hospital is
without a professional suggestionist. The
practice <i>does not involve any metaphysical
theories</i>, the passage of any hidden force
from one brain to another, any ‘planes of
existence,’ or any religious upset, or any
poetic physiology, or the swallowing of any
occult doctrines whatever. It is one of the
simplest and coolest of scientific theories.
It is a question of the relation between the
brain and the bodily organs. It seems never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
to have been clearly stated that healing disease
by suggestion depends not in the least
degree upon any theory of the relation of
mind and matter.... The attempt to
fix an idea in the mind without reason is suggestion.
It is accomplished usually in medical
practice by asking the patient to lie
down and relax his body and his mind and
then vigorously stating to him the desired
idea. It may be accomplished in a number
of ways. The patient may be told that the
operator is a wizard and is about to transfer
an idea from his own mind to that of the
patient. If the patient believes him he will
very likely accept the idea. It may be accomplished
by gestures or incantations which
the patient regards with superstitious awe,
provided it is explained beforehand what
these gestures are meant to produce. It may
be accomplished by telling the patient he has
no body, and sitting with him for awhile in
spiritual silence, <i>provided he knows what
to expect</i>.</p>

<p>“All these methods, <i>if one believes in
them</i>, are good, and they prove by their success
the law of suggestion. But the method<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
that is based on a sure truth is the method
of the scientist. He reasons with his patient,
he stirs in him what moral or religious enthusiasm
he can, and to these means he adds
tactfully the subtle suggestive powers of his
own presence and eloquence. This force, together
with the power which is revealed in
a man of correcting his own mental habits,
is the greatest practical discovery of modern
psychology.... Suggestive therapeutics
is the use of suggestion to fix in the
mind ideas of healthy mental habits....</p>

<p>“Our question is: can the physical conditions
of the brain affect the physical condition
of the stomach? We know that the
brain-building condition which accompanies
the idea of raising our hand can affect the
condition of the muscles of our arm—and we
call that a voluntary function. Now the
question is whether the brain condition which
accompanies the idea of enlivening our
stomach can have an effect upon that involuntary
function. Experiments with suggestion
have proved that in some cases it
can, if it continues long enough. Persons of
a very suggestible nature, can, for instance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
by concentrating their mind upon a certain
part of the body, increase the flow of blood
to that part, although the regulation of blood
flow is supposed to be entirely involuntary.
The action of the heart, also the movements
of the digestive organs particularly, and of
the organs of elimination, are almost directly
affected in suggestible persons by that
change in their brains which accompanies
certain ideas.... Science has established
then, that suggestion can effect to some
extent, the so-called involuntary functions of
the body; but the extent or limitation of
these effects is by no means determined. It
could not be determined scientifically without
years of diligent experiment and tabulation.
Any dogmatic statement upon one
side or the other of that question, is therefore
premature and against the spirit of
science.”</p>

<p>Dr. Leith, in his Edinburgh lectures in
1896, said: “I am inclined to doubt whether
the benefits of Nauheim (a treatment for the
heart) is not after all to be explained largely,
if not entirely, by the influence of the
mental factor.” Tuke says that: “John<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
Hunter says he was subject to spasm of his
‘vital parts’ when anxious about an event;
as, for instance, whether his bees would
swarm or not, whether the large cat he was
anxious to kill would get away before he
could get the gun. After death it was found
that he had some heart disease....
Lord Eglinton told John Hunter how, when
two soldiers were condemned to be shot, it
was arranged the one who threw the number
with the dice should be reprieved; the one
who proved successful generally fainted,
while the one to be shot remained calm.”
Dr. Schofield says: “During the rush of
Consumptives to Berlin for inoculation by
Dr. Koch’s tuberculin, a special set of symptoms
were observed to follow the injection
and were taken as being diagnostic of the
existence of tuberculosis; among others, a
rise of temperature after so many hours.
These phenomena were eagerly looked for
by the patients, and occurred accurately in
several who were injected with pure water.
The formation of blisters full of serum from
the application of plain stamp and other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
paper to various parts of the bodies of patients
in the hypnotic state, is well attested
and undoubtedly true.”</p>

<p>Dr. Krafft-Ebing has produced a rise
from 37 degrees centigrade to 38.5 degrees
centigrade in patients by fixing their minds
by suggestion. In the same way Binet lowered
the temperature 10 degrees centigrade.
The latter authority says: “How can it be,
when one merely says to the patient: ‘Your
hand will become cold,’ and the vaso-motor
system answers by constricting the artery?
<i>C’est ce que depasse notre imagination.</i>”
Schofield commenting on the above, says:
“Indeed there is no way of accounting for
such a phenomena but by freely admitting
the presence of unconscious psychic forces
in the body, capable of so influencing the
structures of the body as to produce physical
changes.” Tuke says: “A lady saw a
child in immediate danger of having its
ankle crushed by an iron gate. She was
greatly agitated, but could not move, owing
to intense pain coming on in her corresponding
ankle. She walked home with difficulty,
took off her stocking and found a circle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
around the ankle of a light red color, with a
large red spot on the outer side. By the
morning her whole foot was inflamed, and
she had to remain in bed for some days.
A young woman witnessing the lancing of
an abscess in the axilla immediately felt pain
in that region, followed by inflammation.
Dr. Marmise of Bordeaux tells us of a lady’s
maid, who when the surgeon put his lancet
into her mistress’s arm to bleed her, felt the
prick in her own arm, and shortly after
there appeared a bruise at the spot.”</p>

<p>It is related that St. Francis d’Assisi dwelt
so long in concentrated meditation upon the
thought and picture of the Crucifixion that
he suffered intense pain in his hands and
feet, at the points corresponding to the place
of the nails in the hands and feet of Christ,
which was afterward followed by marked inflammation
at those points, terminating in
actual ulceration. The phenomena of the
<i>stigmata</i> in the cases of religious enthusiasts
and fanatics has been mentioned elsewhere
in this book. Prof. Barrett says of
the phenomenon: “It is not so well known,
but it is nevertheless the fact, that utterly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
startling physiological changes can be produced
in a hypnotized subject merely by conscious
or unconscious mental suggestion.
Thus a red scar or a painful burn, or even a
figure of a definite shape, such as a cross or
an initial, can be caused to appear on the
body of the entranced subject solely through
suggesting the idea. By creating some local
disturbance of the blood-vessel in the skin,
the unconscious self has done what would be
impossible for the conscious to perform.
And so in the well-attested cases of <i>stigmata</i>,
where a close resemblance to the
wounds of the body of the crucified Saviour
appears on the body of the ecstatic. This is
a case of unconscious self-suggestion, arising
from the intent and adoring gaze of the
ecstatic upon the bleeding figure on the
crucifix.”</p>

<p>Dr. Schofield says: “The breath is altered
by the emotions. The short quiet breath of
joy contrasts with the long sigh of relief
after breathless suspense. Joy gives eupnœa
or easy breathing, grief or rather fear
tends to dyspnœa or difficult breathing.
Sobbing goes with grief, laughter with joy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
and one often merges into the other. Yawning
is produced by pure idea or by seeing it,
as well as by fatigue. Dr. Morton Prince
says a lady he knew always had violent catarrh
in the nose (hay fever) if a rose was
in the room. He gave her an <i>artificial</i> one and
the usual symptoms followed. How many
cases of hay-fever have a somewhat similar
origin in the unconscious mind?...
The hair may be turned grey and white by
emotion in a few hours or sooner. With regard
to the stomach and digestion, apart
from actual disease, we may notice one or two
instances of unconscious mind action. A
man who was very sea-sick lost a valuable
set of artificial teeth overboard, and was instantly
cured. If the thoughts are strongly
directed to the intestinal canal, as by bread-pills,
it will produce strong peristaltic action.
Vomiting occurs from mental causes, apart
from organic brain disease. Bad news will
produce nausea; emotion also, or seeing another
person vomit, or certain smells or
ideas, or thoughts about a sea-voyage, etc.,
or the thought that an emetic has been taken....
The thought of an acid fruit will fill<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
the mouth with water. A successful way of
stopping discordant street music is to suck
a lemon within a full view of a German band.
Fear will so dry the throat that dry rice cannot
be swallowed. This is a test in India
for the detection of a murderer. The suspected
man is brought forward and given a
handful of dry rice to swallow. If he can do
this he is innocent; if he cannot he is guilty,
fear having dried up his mouth....
A young lady who could not be cured of
vomiting was engaged to be married. On
being told that the wedding day must be
postponed till cured, the vomiting ceased....
A mother nursing her child always
found the milk secreted when she heard the
child crying for any length of time. Fear
stops the secretion of milk, and worry will
entirely change its character, so as to become
absolutely injurious to the child.”</p>

<p>Maudsley says: “Perhaps we do not as
physicians consider sufficiently the influence
of mental states in the production of disease,
their importance as symptoms; or realize
all the advantages which we take of them
in our efforts to cure disease. Quackery<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
seems to have got hold of a truth which legitimate
medicine fails to appreciate or use
adequately.” Dr. Buckley says: “A doctor
was called to see a lady with severe rheumatism,
and tried to extemporize a vapor bath
in bed, with an old tin pipe and a tea-kettle;
and only succeeded in scalding the patient
with the boiling water proceeding from
the overful kettle through the pipe. The
patient screamed: ‘Doctor, you have scalded
me,’ and leaped out of bed. But the rheumatism
was cured, and did not return.”
Tuke relates an amusing instance of the
effect of suggestion and faith upon warts.
He had been considering the subject of the
various “pow-wows” or “wart-cures” of the
old women, and determined to try some experiments
in order to see whether these
cures were not due simply to mental influences
and expectant attention. On an
official tour he visited an asylum, where he
was regarded as a great personage by reason
of his office. He noticed that several of
the inmates were afflicted with warts, and
muttering a few words over the excresences,
he told the owners that by such and such a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
day the warts would have completely disappeared.
He forgot the circumstances, owing
to the press of his official duties, and was
agreeably surprised when, on his next round
of visits, he was told that his patients had
been cured at the time he had predicted.
Nearly everyone has had some personal acquaintance
with some of these “pow-wow”
wart cures, in one form or another. Tying
a knot in a piece of cord, then rubbing the
wart with it, and burying the string, has
cured thousands of cases of warts—the suggestion
being the real cause behind the mask.</p>

<p>Ferassi cured fifty cases of ague by a
charm, which consisted merely of a piece of
paper with the word “Febrifuge” written
on it. The patient was directed to clip off
one letter of the word each day until cured.
Some patients recovered as soon as the first
“F” was clipped from the paper. The
writer hereof knows personally of a number
of people having been cured of fever
and ague by means of a written “charm”
which an old man in Philadelphia sold them
at a dollar a copy. The old man informed
him that he, “and his father before him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>”
had cured thousands of people in this way,
making a comfortable living from the practice.
Dr. Gerbe, of Paris, cured 401 out
of 629 cases of toothache by masked suggestion
administered in the form of causing the
patients to crush a small insect between their
fingers, after having strongly impressed
upon them the fact that this was an infallible
cure.</p>

<p>Dr. Schofield reports the following interesting
cases of cures by auto-suggestion and
faith: “A surgeon took into a hospital ward
some time ago, a little boy who had kept his
bed for five years, having hurt his spine in
a fall. He had been all the time totally paralyzed
in the legs, and could not feel when
they were touched or pinched; nor could he
move them in the least degree. After careful
examination, the doctor explained minutely
to the boy the awful nature of the electric
battery, and told him to prepare for its
application the next day. At the same time
he showed him a sixpence, and sympathizing
with his state, told him that the sixpence
should be his if, notwithstanding, he should
have improved enough the next day to walk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
leaning on and pushing a chair, which would
also save the need of the battery. In two
weeks the boy was running races in the park,
and his cure was reported in the ‘<i>Lancet</i>.’ ...
A young lady who had taken ether
three and a half years before, on the inhaler
being held three inches away from the face,
and retaining a faint odor of ether, went
right off, and becoming unconscious without
any ether being used or the inhaler touching
her face. A woman was brought on a
couch into a London hospital by two ladies,
who said she had been suffering from incurable
paralysis of the spine for two years,
and having exhausted all their means in
nursing her, they now sought to get her admitted,
pending her removal to a home
for incurables. In two hours I had cured
her by agencies which owed all their virtue
to their influence on the mind, and I walked
with the woman half a mile up and down the
waiting-room, and she then returned home
in an omnibus, being completely cured. An
amusing case is that of a paralyzed girl,
who on learning that she had secured the affections
of the curate, who used to visit her,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
got out of bed and walked—cured; and soon
afterwards made an excellent pastor’s wife.
A remarkable instance of this sort of cure
is that of a child afflicted with paralysis,
who was brought up from the country to
Paris to the Hotel Dieu. The child, who had
heard a great deal of the wonderful metropolis,
its magnificent hospitals, its omnipotent
doctors, and their wonderful cures, was
awe-struck, and so vividly impressed with
the idea that such surroundings must have
a curative influence, that the day after her
arrival she sat up in bed much better. The
good doctor just passed around, but had not
time to treat her till the third day; by which
time when he came round she was out of
bed, walking about the room, quite restored
by the glimpses she had got of his majestic
presence.”</p>

<p>Having now shown by numerous disinterested
authorities, the majority of whom belong
to the medical profession, that the mental
states of belief, faith and expectancy,
and their negative aspects of fear, apprehension,
and false-belief, may, and do, influence
physical conditions, functioning and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
activities, irrespective of the particular
theory, creed, or explanation accepted by the
patient himself, or herself, we see the necessity
of seeking for the common principle of
cure manifesting in the various forms of
phenomena. And before this common principle
may be grasped, we must needs acquaint
ourselves with the physical organism involved
in the process of cure. Accordingly
the several succeeding chapters will be devoted
to that phase of the general subject.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<p class="center">PSYCHO-THERAPEUTIC METHODS</p>

<p>The reader will have seen from the preceding
chapters that we have proceeded
upon the theory that Suggestion is the universal
operative principle manifesting in all
forms of mental healing, under whatever
guise the latter may be presented and by
whatever method it may be applied. But
it must be remembered that by “Suggestion”
we do not mean the theories of any particular
group of psycho-therapists, but rather
the broad general principle indicated by that
term which operates in the direction of influencing
the Subconscious Mind and its activities.
Let us consider the principle of
Suggestion that we may understand what it
is, and what it is not.</p>

<p>The term “Suggestion” has as its root
the Latin word <i>suggero</i>, which is translated
as follows: <i>sug</i> (or <i>sub</i>), “under;” and
<i>gero</i>, “to carry;” that is, “to carry or place<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
under.” In its general usage it signifies
“The introduction indirectly into the mind
or thoughts; or that which is so introduced.”
Ordinarily a “suggestion” is an idea indirectly
insinuated into the mind, and generally
without the process of argument or
reasoning. In the New Psychology, the term
“suggestion” is used in the sense of an
idea which is “carried under” the objective
or conscious mind, and introduced to
the subjective or Subconscious Mind. In
Suggestive Therapeutics, a “suggestion” is
an idea introduced into that part of the
Subconscious Mind which governs and controls
the physical functions and activities,
and which is embodied in the cells and cell-groups
of the body as we have stated in the
preceding chapters.</p>

<p>By many mental healers the term “Suggestion”
is applied only to the particular
method of applying Suggestion employed by
physicians and others who practice under the
general theories of Suggestive Therapeutics,
and the first mentioned class deny that they
use Suggestion because, as they say, they do
not use the methods of the practitioners of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
Suggestive Therapeutics, and make their
cures by “metaphysical” or “spiritual”
means, or according to some creed or metaphysical
theory which, accepted, works the
cure. We think that the unprejudiced
reader who has followed us this far will have
seen that these metaphysical theories, creeds,
and special dogmas are simply the outward
mask of Suggestion. These healers simply
supply a form of Suggestion which is acceptable
to the patient because of his temperament,
training, etc., and the healing process
operates along the lines of the “faith cure.”</p>

<p>The fact that healers of entirely opposite
theories and doctrines manage to make cures
in about the same proportion and in about
the same time, would seem to prove that the
theories or dogmas have but little to do with
the real work of healing. Whatever form
of Suggestion is most acceptable to the patient,
will best perform the healing work in
that particular case. This will also serve
to explain why some patients failing to obtain
relief from one school of mental healing
often are cured by healers of another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
school, and <i>vice versa</i>. Some need Suggestion
couched in the mystical terms of some
of the cults; others need it garbed in religious
drapings, while others prefer some
vague metaphysical theory which seems
to explain the phenomena. Others still are
repelled by any of the above forms, but respond
readily to the Suggestion of a physician
administering “straight” suggestive
treatment, without any religious, metaphysical,
or mystical disguise. In all of these
cases the real healing work is done by the
Subconscious Mind of the patient himself,
the various forms of Suggestion serving merely
to awaken and rouse into activity the latent
forces of nature.</p>

<p>We invite your consideration of the following
forms of “treatment” for various
disorders, as given by some of the “Divine
Scientists” and other metaphysical and
semi-religious organizations and cults. As
you read them, try to discover the Suggestive
germ so nicely surrounded by the sugar-coating—the
Suggestive pill so cleverly concealed
by the “metaphysical” raisin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span></p>

<p>From a journal published in Chicago several
years ago, called “Universal Truth,”
the following “treatments” were clipped:</p>

<p>A correspondent who asked for a “treatment”
adapted to the cure of <i>nervousness</i>,
is instructed to use the following formula,
which must be “repeated over and over”:</p>

<p>“<i>I am warmed and fed and clothed and
healed by Divine Love.</i>”</p>

<p>Another correspondent is given the following
formula for the cure of sore feet, the
affirmation to be made frequently:</p>

<p>“<i>I so thoroughly understand the divine
working of the Truth, and I so thoroughly
realize the presence of the Father in me and
about me that I am now conscious that omnipotent
Love rules in every atom of my being,
soul and body. My feet can never be weary
nor sore. God created my feet perfect. I
walk the pathway of life in perfect ease and
comfort. All the obstacles in my path have
vanished, and my feet are bathed in a sea of
pure love. Through a knowledge and realization
of the presence of Omnipotence, I
praise and thank God for the perfect spirit
of peace that now dwells within me.</i>”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span></p>

<p>The following additional “treatment” is
suggested to this sufferer from <i>sore feet</i>:</p>

<p>“<i>Mentally place yourself in an attitude to
realize the power of the words you utter, for
the fullness of peace and harmony in your
feet comes with realization. The more frequently
this spiritual medicine is used,
the sooner comes manifestation of perfect
health.</i>”</p>

<p>The same journal contained the following
item:</p>

<p>“The following invigorating affirmations
are used at the Exodus Club, Chicago, Sunday
mornings, the congregation repeating
them after the leader: <i>‘With reverent recognition
of my birthright, I claim my sonship
with the Almighty. I am free from disease
and disorder. I am in harmony with my
source. The Infinite Health is made manifest
in me. The Infinite Substance is my
constant supply. The Infinite Life fills and
strengthens me. The Infinite Intelligence illumines
and directs me. The Infinite Love
surrounds and protects me. The Infinite
Power upholds and supports me. I am out
of bondage. I have the freedom of the sons</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
<i>of God. With all that is in me I rejoice and
give thanks. God and man are the all in all,
now and forever more.</i>’”</p>

<p>The same journal recommends the following
affirmations for general health treatment:</p>

<p>“Monday—<i>Perfect health is my external
birthright</i>.</p>

<p>“Tuesday—<i>I have health of intellect, therefore
I have wise judgment and clear understanding</i>.</p>

<p>“Wednesday—<i>I am morally healthful, therefore
in all my dealings I love to realize that
I am quickened by the spirit of integrity</i>.</p>

<p>“Thursday—<i>Healthfulness of soul gives me
a pure heart and righteousness of motive in
everything I do</i>.</p>

<p>“Friday—<i>Meditation upon the health of my
real being outpictures in physical health and
strength, in even temper, joyous spirits and
in kind words</i>.</p>

<p>“Saturday—<i>My health is inexhaustible, because
I keep my eye steadily fixed upon its
eternal Principle, and my mouth filled with
words of its Omnipotence</i>.</p>

<p>“Sunday—<i>The Father and I are one; one</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
<i>in purpose, alike in Substance, and one in
manifestation</i>.”</p>

<p>In the same journal a correspondent gives
the following treatment for <i>rupture</i>:</p>

<p>“<i>You were conceived in Divine Love. You
are the expression of that pure, perfect Love.
Divine Love is a binding, cementing power.
It is the power that holds all atoms in their
places. Every atom of your body is drawn
and held together in its place by this power.
If any of them get separated as by rupture
or any other appearance, they may be drawn
together and cemented by the omnipotent
power of Love; but the word must be spoken.
Therefore use the following: ‘The omnipotent
spirit of Love in me heals this rupture
and gives me peace.’ Then, mentally realize
the truth of your words, for the Spirit
alone can heal.</i>”</p>

<p>The following treatment for <i>appendicitis</i>
is given in the same journal:</p>

<p>“<i>The false theories of physicians and surgeons,
and the general impressions regarding
that error named Appendicitis are powerless
to produce or perpetuate such manifestation.
The great law of harmony reigns</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
<i>and only waits the universal acknowledgment
of its supremacy to obliterate all such
falsity, thereby obliterating the manifestation.
We claim, therefore, freedom from
such error for every soul. We make this
claim in the name of Jesus Christ.</i>”</p>

<p>From the same source is taken this treatment
for <i>periodical nausea in a child</i>:</p>

<p>“<i>Dear child, every organ of your body is
designed to represent the ideal and perfect
organ in your real spiritual being; and every
function of your body must respond to the
word of truth which is now sent forth to establish
harmony in your consciousness. The
infinite Love that is omnipresent and all-powerful
permeates and penetrates every
organ and function of your body, and corrects
every tendency to discord or disease.
By that infinite Love you are now made
free. You are fearless and free. You are
joyous and free. You are free from the fear
of others. You manifest health, strength
and peace. Harmony reigns in mind and
body. The word of truth has made you
free.</i>”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span></p>

<p>Also the following treatment for <i>constipation</i>:</p>

<p>“<i>I do realize that the power of divine
Love so permeates every atom of my being
that my bowels move freely and without effort.
This inflowing of divine Love removes
all obstructions and I am healed. I realize
joy and eternal life so fully that the spirit of
Peace is ever present with me. I acknowledge
the fullness of joy, peace and power,
and have come into a realization of my oneness
with infinite Spirit; therefore I rest in
thee, O my father.</i>”</p>

<p>Another journal of “Divine Science” gave
the following “Health Thought” to be held
during the month:</p>

<p>“<i>All the natural channels of my body are
open and free. The substance of my body is
good.</i>”</p>

<p>Also the following treatment for <i>general
health</i>:</p>

<p>“<i>What is true of God is true of man. God
is the One All, and is always in a state of
wholeness. I, the man of God, am always
whole, like unto the One All. No false belief
environs or limits me. No shadow darkens</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
<i>my mental vision. My body is a heavenly
body, and my eyes do behold the glory of
God in all visible things. I am well, and provided
for, thank God, and nothing can make
me think otherwise.</i>”</p>

<p>While to the orthodox practitioner of
medicine the above affirmation and “treatments”
may seem to be nothing but a ridiculous
conglomeration of mystical, religious
and metaphysical terms, without sequence,
logical relation, or common-sense, <i>it is true
that statements and treatments similar to
the above have successfully healed many
cases of physical ailments</i>. There are thousands
of people who will testify that they
were healed in a similar manner, and the
majority of them believed that there was
some particular and peculiar virtue in the
formula used, or in the theories and beliefs
upon which the formula was based. But the
unprejudiced student of Suggestion will
readily see that the real healing force was
with the mind and being of the patients
themselves, and that the <i>faith, belief and expectant
attention</i> was aroused by the formula
and the theories. The principle is that of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
all Faith Cures—the principle of Suggestion.</p>

<p>Other schools of metaphysical or religious
healers treat the patient by impressing upon
his mind the fact that God being perfect,
good and loving could not be guilty of creating
evil, pain or disease, and that such
things are non-existent in the “Divine
Mind,” and are merely illusion, errors, or
false claims of the “mortal mind,” or “carnal
mind” of the patient; therefore, if the
patient will deny their reality, and will admit
as existent only such things as are held
in the Divine Mind, <i>i. e.</i>, the <i>good</i> things,
then the evil things, being merely illusions
and untruths, must of necessity fade away
and disappear and perfect health will result.
Others treat their patients by impressing
upon their minds the idea that sickness and
disease is either the world or “the devil,”
or of the “principle of evil,” the latter being
described as “the negation of truth,”
and similar terms; and that therefore fixing
the mind and faith upon the “principle of
Good,” or God, must result in driving away<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
the evil conditions. Others hold that disembodied
spirits are aiding in the cure. There
are thousands of variations rung on the
chimes of metaphysical or religious suggestions
in the cults. <i>And they all make some
cures</i>, remember—<i>in spite of their theories</i>
rather than because of them.</p>

<p>The Mental Scientists come nearest to the
ideas of the New Psychology, when they
teach that “As a man thinketh, so is he,”
and that the mind of man creates physical
conditions, good and evil, and that the constant
holding of the ideal of perfect health
and the assertion thereof, will restore normal
healthy conditions to the person suffering
from physical ailments. Mental Science
is very near to being “straight suggestion”
so far as the actual method of treatment is
concerned, although it resembles some of the
other cults when it begins to speculate or
dogmatize regarding the nature of the universe,
etc.</p>

<p>Differing from these metaphysical, mystical,
or religious schools of healing in theory,
although employing the same principle, we
find the school of Suggestive Therapeutics,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
proper, favored by many of the regular
physicians and by a number of other healers
who base their treatment upon the idea of
“straight suggestion” coupled with hygienic
truth and rational physiological facts. Perhaps
a better idea of the theories and ideas
of this school may be obtained by referring
to the actual treatments given by some of
their leading practitioners.</p>

<p>Herbert A. Parkyn, M. D., an eminent
practitioner of Suggestive Therapeutics,
gives the following instruction to his pupils:
“Students often ask for information as to
what they should say to a patient when
thorough relaxation is realized. As no two
cases are exactly alike, it follows that the
suggestions given must necessarily fit the
case, and be given with a view to bring
about the mental and physical condition desired.
For instance, in treating a patient
who is afflicted with insomnia, suggestions
of sleep should be persistently given; and
in cases of malnutrition suggestions of hunger
should be made to stimulate the appetite
for food. The operator should bear in mind
that <i>the reiteration of the suggestion that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
will change the condition existing, to that
desired, is always the right one</i>, and his own
intelligence will be the best guarantee as to
what the suggestion should be.... Always
arouse the expectant attention of a patient....
So logical a line of argument
can be made that each patient will have a
reason for expecting certain conditions to be
brought about. <i>With the patient’s attention
on the desired results, they generally
come to pass.</i> It is better not to give negative
suggestions, such as, ‘You will not, or
cannot do this, that or the other thing,’ etc.
Pointing out what is not desirable does not
suffice. In place of such suggestions, tell
what you really wish your patients to do.
For example, if a man should mount his
bicycle incorrectly, he would profit nothing
if we should merely tell him that the way he
mounted was not the proper one. How much
easier it would be for all concerned if the
proper manner of mounting should be shown
at once. Just so it is with therapeutic suggestions,
<i>keep suggesting the conditions of
mind or body you wish to bring about</i>.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span></p>

<p>The following treatment given as an example
by F. W. Southworth, M. D., in his
little book on “True Metaphysical Science,
and its Practical Application through the
Law of Suggestion,” furnishes an excellent
illustration of the form of suggestive treatment
favored by this particular school. The
patient is addressed as follows:</p>

<p>“As thoughts are not only things, but
forces and act upon our mental and physical
life for good or ill, we must be careful to
always keep ourselves in that condition of
thought which builds up and strengthens, to
constantly think thoughts of <i>health</i>, of <i>happiness</i>,
of <i>good</i>, to be <i>cheerful</i>, hopeful, confident
and fearless. (Repeat five or six
times.) In order to sustain this condition
of positive thinking it requires the development
of the will power. The will is the
motive power and the controlling force in all
aspects of our life, but we develop it especially
for the concentration and control of
thought. This is the higher self—the infinite
will. Exercise it with vigor and earnest
persistency, and learn to <i>rely</i> upon it. Assert
its power as you assert the power of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
muscles in exercise and it will manifest itself
and the thought will be positive, the
secretions of the body will be normal, and
the circulation of the blood in the head will
be kept at that proper equilibrium which insures
the constant nutrition of the cells of
the brain and their constant vigor and
strength of control of all the organs and tissues
of the body, and this vast and intricate
machinery of the body will work harmoniously
for the production of nutrition
through elaboration of the food elements.</p>

<p>“As our body is constantly changing and
wasting, we must rebuild and restore it constantly,
and we do so from the air we
breathe, the water we drink, and the food
we eat. The most important of these is the
air you breathe, as it is not only a food in
itself to the tissues, but it vitalizes the food
you eat and the water you drink. Give it
that quality of your thought and breathe it
as you have been directed at least six times
per day for a period of from five to ten minutes
each time. Recognize it as both a food
and an eliminator of poisons, as it is, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
breathe, breathe, breathe, by Nature’s method,
and the lungs will distribute the oxygen
to the blood, and the blood being
the common carrier of the body will take
it to all parts of the body and on its return
will gather up all the waste and poisonous
matters and will bring them to the lungs,
where, meeting the fresh oxygen, they will
be burned up and exhaled as carbonic acid
gas, leaving the body pure and clean.</p>

<p>“The water you drink, in the proportion
of three and one-half pints each day, is
necessary in all adult bodies to insure perfect
secretion and excretion. As the result
of this required liquid being provided in normal
quantity, the secreting glands will
manufacture the proper amount of juices
needed in digestion, absorption and assimilation
of your food, and the excreting glands,
those which bring about excretion or the removal
of waste matters from the body—the
liver giving you the bile, which produces a
daily movement of the bowels—the kidneys
and bladder removing the chemical deposits
which come about through the processes of
digestion, and the skin excreting a large<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
amount of waste matter from its twelve
square feet of surface, which you remove
with a towel each morning after moistening
it with cold water. By following these laws
of Nature you will have a good appetite and
digestion, a daily movement of the bowels,
refreshing sleep, and, as your nutrition is
restored from day to day, a feeling of satisfaction
and happiness will be the result. Be
earnest and persistent and do everything
cheerfully, with a firm determination of doing
your part to restore nutrition.</p>

<p>“When you breathe, give it the quality of
your thought; it is for the purpose of getting
food, life; feeding from the air and
eliminating poisons from your body. (Repeat
five and six times.) When you sip the
water, think each time that it is to produce
perfect secretion and excretion—to give you
a good appetite, digestion, refreshing sleep
and a free movement of the bowels each
morning. (Repeat five or six times.) Each
day look forward to the morrow for progress
and advancement. Think health—talk
it and nothing else. Do not talk with anyone
about disease or allow any person to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
talk to you on such subjects. <i>Be cheerful</i>,
<i>hopeful</i>, <i>confident</i> and fearless always, and
you will be happy and healthy. Eat, drink,
breathe and be merry.”</p>

<p>It will be noticed that in the above described
treatment, the suggestions are made
along physiological and hygienic lines. That
is, the suggestions indicate the physiological
processes which are performed normally in
the healthy person, the idea being to set up
an ideal pattern for the Subconscious Mind
to follow. In all scientific suggestive treatment
the idea is always to paint a mental
picture of the <i>desired conditions</i> rather than
to dwell upon the existing undesirable conditions.
The <i>ideal</i> is always held up to view,
and the patient’s mind is led to <i>realize</i> the
ideal—to make the ideal real—to manifest
the thought in action—to materialize the
mental picture.</p>

<p>The general principles of Suggestive
Therapeutics may be applied effectively by
means of Auto-Suggestion. In fact, the “affirmations,”
“statements” and “assertions”
used by many of the New Thought
schools are but forms of Auto-Suggestion.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
There is no essential difference between the
Suggestion given by others, and the Auto-Suggestion
given by one’s self to one’s self.
The healing power is in the mind of the patient,
and whether it is called forth by his
own Auto-Suggestion or the Suggestion of a
healer matters not. The Auto-Suggestion is
merely a case of self-healing by Suggestion,
and is administered upon the principle of
“every man his own suggestionist”—“sez I
to meself, sez I.” Auto-Suggestions are
usually given to one’s self in the form of
“affirmations,” as, “I am improving; my
stomach is doing its work well, digesting
what is given it, and the nourishment is assimilated,
etc.” In other works by the
writer hereof, the method of addressing
one’s self as one would another is recommended
as particularly efficacious. That is
to say, instead of saying, “<i>I</i> am, etc.,” in
Auto-Suggestion, it is better to address one’s
self in the second person, as “<i>John Smith</i>
(naming yourself), <i>you</i> are, etc.” In short,
the Auto-Suggestion seems to have additional
force imparted to it by being directed
as if it were being given to another person.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span></p>

<p>The following thought of Dr. Schofield is
worthy of careful consideration in connection
with the methods of applying Suggestion.
He says, referring to the treatment of
hysterical disorders and ailments: “We
must, however, remember one great point
with regard to suggestion—that it is like
nitrogen. Nitrogen is the essential element
in all animal life; it forms four-fifths of the
air we breathe, and yet, curious to say, we
have no power to use it in a pure state. We
can only take it unconsciously, when combined
with other substances in the form of
proteid food. It is the same with suggestions.
Not one hysterical sufferer in a hundred
can receive and profit by them in a raw
state—that is, consciously; they must generally
be presented, as we have said, indirectly
to the subconscious mind by the treatment
and environment of the patient. An electric
shock often cures slight hysterical diseases
instantaneously, acting, as it often
does, on the unconscious mind through the
conscious. No doubt it would be easier if we
could say to these sufferers, ‘The disease is
caused by suggestions from ideal centers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
and to cure it, all you have to do is to
believe you are well.’ Still, it would be as
impossible for us to take our nitrogen pure
from the air, the mind cannot as a rule be
thus acted on directly when the brain is unhealthy.
Suggestion must be wrapped in objective
treatment, directed ostensibly and
vigorously to the simulated disease.”</p>

<p>Not only is the above true regarding the
treatment of hysterical disorders, but to <i>all</i>
disorders as well. The methods which will
bring about the best results must be carefully
modeled upon the patient’s particular
temperament, education, prejudices for and
against, and general belief. The skilled suggestionist
adapts his treatment and methods
to each individual case coming to him for
treatment. Whatever method will best
arouse the patient’s belief, faith and expectant
attention is the best method for administering
the suggestions. The successful
suggestionist must be “all things to all men,”
never, however, losing sight of the fundamental
principle of Suggestion—the arousing
of faith, belief, and expectant attention.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>

<p class="center">THE REACTION OF THE PHYSICAL</p>

<p>As we have stated in our Foreword, there
is a constant action and reaction between the
Mental States and the Physical Conditions.
In this book, from the nature of our subject,
we have started with the phase of the Mental
State and worked from that point to the
consideration of the Physical Condition. In
the same way, many physiologists start from
the phase of the Physical Condition, and
work up to the Mental State. But, starting
from either phase, the candid investigator
must admit that there is an endless chain of
action and reaction between Mind and Body—between
Body and Mind.</p>

<p>This action and reaction works along the
lines of building-up as well as tearing-down.
For instance, if a person’s Mental States are
positive, optimistic, cheerful and uplifting,
the body will respond and the Physical Conditions
will improve. The Physical Condi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>tions,
thus improving, will react upon the
Mental States giving them a clearness and
strength greater than previously manifested.
The improved Mental State again acts upon
the Physical Conditions, improving the latter
still further. And so on, an endless chain
of cause and effect, each effect becoming a
cause for a subsequent effect, and each cause
arising from a preceding effect. Likewise, a
depressed, harmful Mental State will act
upon the Physical Conditions, which in turn
will react upon the Mental States, and so on,
in an endless chain of destructive cause and
effect. It is a striking illustration of the old
Biblical statement: “To him who hath shall
be given; to him who hath not shall be taken
away even that which he hath.” In improving
either the Mental State or the Physical
Condition, one gives an uplift to the whole
process of action and reaction; while, whatever
adversely affects either Mental State or
Physical Condition, starts into operation a
depressing and destructive process of action
and reaction. The ideal to be aimed at is, of
course, “A healthy Mind in a healthy Body”—and
the two are so closely related that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
what affects one, favorably or unfavorably,
is sure to react upon the other.</p>

<p>Just as the influence of the Mental States
over the Physical Conditions has been
shown to operate by means of the Sympathetic
Nervous System (controlled of course
by the Subconscious Mind), so the influence
of Physical Conditions over Mental States
may be explained in physiological terms.
In order to understand the reaction of the
Body upon the Mind, we have but to recall
the fact that the Subconscious Mind is the
builder and preserver of the very brain-cells
which are used by the Conscious Mind
in manifesting thought. And also, that the
entire Nervous System, both Cerebro-Spinal
as well as Sympathetic, is really under the
control of the Subconscious Mind so far as
growth and nourishment is concerned. The
very brain and nerve-centers in and through
which is manifested thought, feeling, emotion,
and will, are nourished by the Sympathetic
System, and are hurt by anything affecting
the latter. The Sympathetic System
joins all parts of the organism so closely together
that trouble in one part is reflected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
in other parts. Just as depressing thoughts
will cause the organs to function improperly,
so will the improper functioning of an organ
tend to produce depressing thoughts.</p>

<p>Herbert A. Parkyn, M. D., well states the
action and reaction of Mind and Body, as
follows: “A tree is much like a human being.
Give it plenty of fresh air, water and
a rich soil, and it will flourish. In the same
degree in which it is deprived of these does
it wilt, and <i>the first part of the tree to wilt
when the nutrition becomes imperfect is the
top</i>. This is owing to the force of gravity;
the blood of the tree, the sap, having to
overcome this force of nature when nourishing
the highest leaves. The blood of man is
also affected by this same force, and the
moment a man’s circulation begins to run
down, owing to stinted nutrition, we find
that the first symptoms of trouble appear in
the head.... The brain failing to receive
its accustomed amount of blood, such
troubles as impaired memory, inability to
concentrate the attention, sleeplessness, nervousness,
irritableness, the blues and slight
headaches develop; and the impulses sent all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
over the body becoming feebler, the various
organs do not perform their functions as
satisfactorily as usual. The impulses to the
stomach and bowels becoming weaker and
weaker, dyspepsia, or constipation, or both,
soon follow. As soon as these, the main organs
of nutrition, are out of order, nutrition
fails rapidly and more ‘head symptoms’ develop.
Every impulse of the muscular system
leaves the brain, and the strength of
these impulses depends upon the nutrition
to the brain centers controlling the various
groups. As the nutrition to these centers
declines, the whole muscular system, including
the muscles of the bowels, becomes
weaker and the patient complains that he
exhausts easily. The impulses for elimination
becoming weaker, waste products remain
in the circulation, and any of the evils,
which naturally follow this state of affairs,
such as rheumatism, sick-headache, biliousness,
etc., are likely to develop. The centers
of the special senses feeling the lessening of
the vital fluid, such troubles as impaired
vision, impaired hearing, loss of appetite
(sense of taste) and inability to detect odors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
quickly soon follow. The sense of touch becomes
more acute, and it is for this reason
that one in poor health becomes hypersensitive.
Lowered circulation in the mucous
membrane of the throat and nose is often
the cause of nasal catarrh appearing on the
scene as an early symptom.”</p>

<p>It will thus be seen that the Physical Conditions,
perhaps originally caused by depressing
Mental States, have brought about
a state of affairs in which the brain is imperfectly
nourished and which consequently
cannot think properly. The liver being out
of order, the spirits are depressed; the brain
being imperfectly nourished, the attention
and will are weakened, and the patient finds
it hard to use his mind to influence his bodily
conditions. The bowels not moving
properly, the waste-products poison the circulation,
and the brain is unable to think
clearly. In fact, the whole physical system
is often so disturbed that a condition known
as “nervous prostration” sets in, in which
it is practically impossible for the patient to
hold the Mental States which will improve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
the Physical Conditions. In these cases outside
help is generally necessary, unless in
cases where a sudden shock, or an urgent
necessity arouses the latent mental forces of
the individual, and he asserts the power that
is in him, and begins to reverse the chain of
cause and effect and to start on the upward
climb.</p>

<p>The following additional quotation from
Dr. Parkyn, gives us a vivid insight into the
effect upon the Mental States of abnormal
Physical Conditions: Dr. Parkyn says: “No
organ of the body can perform its functions
properly when the amount of blood supplied
to it is insufficient, and we find, when the
blood supply to the brain is not up to the
normal standard, that brain functions are
interfered with to a degree corresponding to
the reduction in the circulation. Since the
amount of blood normally supplied to the
brain is lessened in nervous prostration, we
find that the memory fails and the ability to
concentrate the attention disappears. The
reasoning power becomes weakened and the
steadiest mind commences to vacillate.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
Fears and hallucinations of every description
may fill the mind of a patient at this
stage, and every impression he receives is
likely to be greatly distorted or misconstrued.
Melancholia with a constant fear of
impending danger is often present. In fact,
the brain seems to lose even the power to
control its functions, and the mind becomes
active day and night.... The reduction
of the nutrition to the brain lessens the
activity of all the cerebral centers also,
and digestion becomes markedly impaired,
thereby weakening the organ itself upon
which the supply of vital force depends.”</p>

<p>The physiologist is able to furnish a great
variety of illustrations of the effect of Physical
Conditions over Mental States. He
shows that many cases of mental trouble are
due to eye-strain, and other muscular disturbances,
and that serious mental complaints
sometimes arise by reason of physical
lesions. The very terms used to designate
certain abnormal mental states show
the relation, as for instance, <i>melancholia</i>
which is derived from the Greek words
meaning “black bile”; and <i>hysteria</i>, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
is derived from the Greek word meaning “the
womb; or uterus.” Every one knows the
Mental States produced by a sluggish liver,
or by dyspepsia, or from constipation. We
all know the difference between our mental
capacity for thinking when we are tired, as
contrasted with that accompanying the refreshed
physical condition. No man, whatever
his philosophy, can truthfully claim to
be able to maintain a placid, even disposition,
and a perfectly controlled temper, when
he is suffering from a boil on the back of his
neck. And, all know that after indulging in
the midnight “Welsh rarebit,” one is apt to
dream of his grandmother’s ghost, or see
dream elephants with wings. All know the
delirium produced by overindulgence in
liquor, and the hallucinations that accompany
fever. The effect of drugs, tobacco,
and alcohol upon the Mental States are well
known. “Philip drunk” is a very different
mentality from “Philip sober.” The Mental
States accompanying particular diseases
are well known to physicians. One disease
predisposes the sufferer to gloominess, while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
another will induce a state of feverish hilarity.
Some leading authorities now hold
that many cases of insanity are really due
to abnormal conditions of the blood, rather
than to any diseased condition of the brain.</p>

<p>One of the most marked instances of the
action and reaction of Mental States and
Physical Conditions is met with in the activities
of the sexual organism. Psychologists
very properly hold that sexual excesses
and abnormalities are largely due to improper
thinking, that is, by allowing the attention
and interest to dwell too strongly and continuously
upon subjects connected with the activities
of that part of the physical system.
Mental treatment along the lines of Suggestive
Therapeutics has resulted in curing
many persons of troubles of this sort. But,
note the correlated fact—excess and abnormalities
of the kind mentioned, almost invariably
react upon the mentality of the person
indulging in them, and softening of the
brain, paralysis, or imbecility have often
arisen directly from these physical abuses.
It will be seen that any sane treatment of
these troubles must take into consideration<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
both Body and Mind. In the same way it is
a fact that just as certain Mental States, notably
those of fear, worry, grief, jealousy,
etc., will injuriously affect the organs of digestion
and assimilation, so will imperfect
functioning of these organs tend to produce
depressing mental states similar to those
just mentioned. Many instances of the
strange correspondences are met with in the
study of physiological-psychology, or psychological-physiology.</p>

<p>In order to more fully appreciate the relation
between the Body and the Mind, let
us read the following lines from Prof. Halleck:
“Marvelous as are the mind’s achievements,
we must note that it is as completely
dependent upon the nervous system as is a
plant upon sun, rain and air. Suppose a
child of intelligent parents were ushered into
the world without a nerve leading from his
otherwise perfect brain to any portion of his
body, with no optic nerve to transmit the
glorious sensations from the eye, no auditory
nerve to conduct the vibrations of the
mother’s voice, no tactile nerves to convey
the touch of a hand, no olfactory nerve to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
rouse the brain with the delicate aroma from
the orchards and the wild flowers in spring,
no gustatory, thermal or muscular nerves.
Could such a child live, as the years rolled
on, the books of Shakespeare and of Milton
would be opened in vain before the child’s
eyes. The wisest men might talk to him
with utmost eloquence, all to no purpose.
Nature could not whisper one of her inspiring
truths into his deaf ear, could not light
up that dark mind with a picture of the rainbow
or of a human face. No matter how
perfect might be the child’s brain and his
inherited capacity for mental activities, his
faculties would remain for this life shrouded
in Egyptian darkness. Perception could
give memory nothing to retain, and thought
could not weave her matchless fabrics without
materials.”</p>

<p>The very feelings or emotions themselves
are so closely related to the accompanying
physical expressions, that it is difficult to
distinguish between cause and effect, or indeed
to state positively which really is
the cause of the other. Prof. William<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
James, in some of his works, strongly indicates
this close relation, as for instance
when he says: “The feeling, in the coarser
emotions, result from the bodily expression....
My theory is that the bodily changes
follow directly the perception of the exciting
fact, and that our feeling of the same
changes as they occur <i>is</i> the emotion....
Particular perceptions certainly do produce
widespread bodily effects by a sort of immediate
physical influence, antecedent to the
arousal of an emotion or emotional idea....
Every one of the bodily changes,
whatsoever it may be, is <i>felt</i>, acutely or obscurely,
the moment it occurs.... If
we fancy some strong emotion, and then try
to abstract from our consciousness of it all
the feelings of its bodily symptoms, we have
nothing left behind.... A disembodied
human emotion is a sheer nonentity. I do
not say that it is a contradiction in the nature
of things, or that pure spirits are necessarily
condemned to cold intellectual lives;
but I say that for <i>us</i> emotion disassociated
from all bodily feelings is inconceivable.
The more closely I scrutinize my states, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
more persuaded I become that whatever
‘coarse’ affections and passions I have are
in very truth constituted by, and made up
of, those bodily changes which we ordinarily
call their expression or consequence....
But our emotions must always be <i>inwardly</i>
what they are, whatever may be the physiological
ground of their apparition. If they
are deep, pure, worthy, spiritual facts on
any conceivable theory of their physiological
source, they remain no less deep, more
spiritual, and worthy of regard on this present
sensational theory.”</p>

<p>A deeper consideration of the relation between
Mind and Body would necessitate our
invading the field of metaphysical speculation,
which we have expressed our intention
to avoid doing. Enough for the purposes of
our present consideration is: <i>the recognition
that each individual is possessed of a mind
and a material body; that these two phases
or aspects of himself are closely related by
an infinite variety of ties and filaments; that
these two phases of his being act and react
upon each other constantly and continuously;
that in all considerations of the questiontion</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
<i>of either mental or physical well-being,
or both, that both of these phases of being
must be considered; that any system of
therapeutics which ignores either of these
phases, is necessarily “one-sided” and incomplete;
and that, while, for convenience
and clearness of specialized thinking, we
may consider the Mind and the Body as separate
and independent of each other, yet, we
must, in the end, recognize their interdependence,
mutual relation, action and reaction.</i></p>

<p>Thus, the New Psychology recognizes the
importance of the Body, while the New Physiology
recognizes the importance of the
Mind. And, in the end, we feel that both
physiology and psychology must be recognized
as being but two different phases of
one great science—the Science of Life.</p>
